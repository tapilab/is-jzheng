stayed in a king suite for 11 nights and yes it cots us a bit but we were happy with the standard of room the location and the friendliness of the staff our room was on the 20th floor overlooking broadway and the madhouse of the fairway market room was quite with no noise evident from the hallway or adjoining rooms it was great to be able to open windows when we craved fresh rather than heated air the beds including the fold out sofa bed were comfortable and the rooms were cleaned well wifi access worked like a dream with only one connectivity issue on our first night and this was promptly responded to with a call from the service provider to ensure that all was well the location close to the 72nd street subway station is great and the complimentary umbrellas on the drizzly days were greatly appreciated it is fabulous to have the kitchen with cooking facilities and the access to a whole range of fresh foods directly across the road at fairway this is the second time that members of the party have stayed at the beacon and it will certainly be our hotel of choice for future visits
on every visit to nyc the hotel beacon is the place we love to stay so conveniently located to central park lincoln center and great local restaurants the rooms are lovely  beds so comfortable a great little kitchen and new wizz bang coffee maker the staff are so accommodating and just love walking across the street to the fairway supermarket with every imaginable goodies to eat if you choose not to go out for every meal
this is a great property in midtown we two different rooms different rooms during our stay the first room was in the north tower which was quite inconvenient you have to go through the conference area to get to the north elevators  the second room was the andaz suite it was nicely appointed room but the best part about it was the bathroom from the foot soaking bowl to the bath products everything about the bathroom was awesome lemon poppyseed pancakes are must haves at the restaurant one of the best pancakes ever
the andaz is a nice hotel in a central location of manhattan the hyatt has come up with a modern hotel that is both comfortable and convenient when you arrive you are greeted by friendly hosts and they walk you to the checkin desk while offering you a beverage  we had a one bedroom suite that accommodated four people reasonably well plenty of closet space well lit with floor to ceiling windows and actually quiet the bathroom was large with a very nice walkin shower and a builtin bench with unique low spout to wash your feet the kitchenette was a nice touch with a stocked fridge offering complimentary nonalcoholic beverages and snacks dishes and utensils a sink dishwasher and a microwave  they have daily happy hours where you can get a complimentary decent glass of wine in the modest lobby lounge and bring it to your room the lobby lounge has some seating and one table with 8 or so chairs where you can buy food from the adjacent restaurant one suggestion is to offer selections of cheese and crackers platters to go with that wine we ordered one that had to be custom made but it worked well  we didnt eat in the hotel restaurants the restaurant off the lobby was very pricey for breakfast 20 per entree when you can get a decent breakfast within a block or two of the hotel for under 10 what can i say as a hotel designer and someone who is very picky about hotels i will definitely stay there again and i highly recommend it
i have stayed at each of the us andaz properties and this one is the best of them all much better than the west hollywood property where brand standards are slowly fading this is the shining star here in the states my room suite on the 12th floor was fantastic as usual perfectly maintained very comfortable great bathrooms best in nyc the bathroom is huge with large shower room and multiple shower heads double lavatories flank one wall huge the bed is always perfect televisions in both rooms were perfect for my limited time spend in the suite nice desk for work area and in room dining  every room has a fridge with complimentary soft drinks snacks water sparkling water milk and juices nice touch suite has full size refrigerator with icemaker and also features a microwave sink and dishwasher drawerall nicely concealed behind beautiful cabinetry really great for a longer stay i do have 2 complaints first the elevators the waits were sometimes ridiculous 3 elevators serve the main tower with a rather limited number of rooms this is a newer hotel but there is no service elevator i was continually surprised after waiting for an elevator at how many stops we made for housekeeping to enter with carts room service carts and trays etc how could hyatt skip a service elevator on this new property it really stinks at timesits bad lastly i have traveled with world and certainly know nyc pricing breakfast at the andaz ranks above almost anything i have ever paid apparently i had a 19000 breakfast for two the first morning and 17500 the second eggs for each coffee berries wow of course i really dont knowas there is no bill they just deliver it and leave prices are listed in the insuite menu but no itemized billing is given i am gifted with a 7500 credit for my breakfast as a diamond member and i assumed that had not been applied when my bill reflected a non itemized charge for 110 plus for the first night and slightly less for the second i was wrong it had been applied no way for me to see this wow it certainly isnt worth it i know i sound like one of those guys who complains about pricing but clearly doesnt know what things cost wrong this one really surprised me and i have traveled the world for more than 20 years staying in some of the finest hotels in the world andaz is great but it doesnt rank with many that i have had the pleasure of staying with i just had breakfast this morning for 2 at the four seasons nyc it was half the costalmost  stay away from room service in my opinion
excellent staff they remembered our names from the moment our family walked in our original suite was overbooked so we ended up in a much nicer suite no complaints here extremely convenient location to fifth avenue shopping restaurants and subway system use the concierge they worked magic throughout our entire stay regardless of whether we needed tickets or merely a ride the staff would go out of their way to make sure we were happy honestly will have trouble staying at any other hotel in the nyc area room service was superb one of our family members forgot their toothbrush we called downstairs and within 3 minutes we had four  for those who stay at this hotel theres always a chance at a celebrity sighting our hotel neighbor happened to be jamie foxx who was staying during his django unchained promotional tour
i stayed at the setai for 3 nights last week as my company reserved a block for us although the hotel is not near lincoln center which is where we shuttled to every day i found the hotel to be a true gem i have stayed at countless hotels in nyc and this is by far the best value loved the spacious rooms modern furnishings and all the free offerings mini bar cookies internet pressing reginachris in sales stayed all night to help coordinate my guests and brianmattlouis from the front desk could not have been nicer the door men were amazing they assisted our lastminute transport needs with grace special thank you to joe mike and the security team my boss is very hard to impress and he has already mentioned he would like to book again next year
my husband and i stayed at the chatwal for 9 nights in april 2012 we booked our rooms via bookingcom we arrived at the hotel very late at night but our checkin was very easy and just like many other reviewers we got upgraded to a suite we fell in love with the decor it is just like the photos in the hotel website the lobby smelled lovely with their signature scent it was even lovelier when mixed with the fresh coffee smell in the morning  beds were extremely comfortable books in the room were a nice touch we had two bathrooms after our upgrade which we appreciated a lot the bathrooms were really very chic and the toto toilets were something  the housekeeping service was really good with turndown service we had drinks at the lambs club bar nearly every night with our friends and were very happy with everything we had dinner at the lambs club restaurant downstairs and were very pleased we did not have breakfast at the hotel as there are a lot of alternatives close by my husband had a couple of prearranged deliveries and the concierge were very helpful with them we thank mr mullins for all his help we never saw our butler during our 9 night stay therefore i cannot comment on the butler service but we did not really need it anyway  overall a great 5star boutique hotel experience in a very central nyc location
wonderful boutique hotel located next to times square subway is two blocks away to all of manhattan numerous classic eateries within walking distance bathrooms are ideal with japanese heated cleansing toilettes
this hotel is a nice stay for nyc because the rooms are very clean hotel is very comfortable and its in a great location a few blocks from herald square 34th street shopping madison square gardens penn stationeverything the staff was very nice and always accommodating the hotel also has a great view of the empire state building in rooms facing 6th ave very cool pic to have if you get lucky i was extremely satisfied with the my two nights stay and would stay again
ive stayed at 4 and 5 star hotels all over manhattan over the past year however i have returned each time to the eventi wonderful staff beautiful hotel incredibly comfortable rooms and for my needs terrific location
stayed at this hotel for four nights in december 2012 it is perfectly located two blocks from times square and one block from fifth avenue we found it a perfect base to explore all manhattan has to offer walking to central park took approximately 20 minutes times square was less than 5 minutes away and with close subway stations access to all of manhattan is a piece of cake with regard the hotel itself we were very happy with out choice location aside the hotel was very clean and well appointed we had a room on the 11th floor and after sending the hotel an email prior to our arrival they provided a room with a view of the chrysler building as requested the room itself was a decent size tidy bathroom with powerful shower and molton brown products the hotel has two lifts servicing all floor and we never had to wait for a lift both the concierge and the front desk staff were very helpful and courteous as were the bell boys a wonderful little touch was the urn in the reception area in the morning it was full of coffee with cups available for you to take out with you and from the afternoon onwards hot cider was available  very happy with our choice and wont hesitate to return the next time we visit new york
hotel was very very good high quality finish throughout very comfortable bed lovely breakfast great location hotel is a few minutes walk from rockefeller center and 5th avenue the subway is right on your door only slight critique would be the night life tends to close around 11pm in the immediate area very minor issue as we were not in new york to get drunk breakfast was basic but perfectly acceptable lovely fresh continental breakfast decent coffee fruit juices yoghurts you can eat as much as you like and grab a coffee before you head into new york the door staff were great they found us a taxi at rush hour in the rain which in nyc isnt the easiest thing to do the only problem we had was that our safe was not working when we arrived battery was duff but this was fixed within 20 mins overall no complaints would definitely return again
we chose the san carlos based on reviews in ta and were not disappointed location was great rooms large in good condition well appointed and staff friendly and helpful san carlos was a great location for all the mid and uptown events and attractions we had planned close enough for an easy walk to times square but far enough away from the crowd and noise near to subway for added convenience the guest rooms are quite large though the bath is smaller but we would recommend to friends and stay again on our next nyc visit
the service location cleanliness were outstanding even though the hot water was supposed to be off from 1100 pm to 600 am do not know if it was or not it did not affect me it is a great hotel to walk fromto as one gets the full flavor of 5th avenue
this is one of the best and my favorite swanky hotel in new york city when in nyc this is where i stay an intimate atmosphere attentive courteous staff wonderful location across the street from central park wonderful bar and restaurants this is what the ritz carltons try to be  if youve never stayed at the sherry netherland i suggest you try it if you have stayed there then you must know what i am talking about
when we pulled up at the curb in front of the hotel we were greeted immediately by the bellman he whisked our luggage into the hotel the car was taken care of and we were instantly relaxing enjyoing nyc
loved the hotel great location  only 2 blocks from 72nd st subway we had a 1 bedroom suite on the 24th floor and had a wonderful view of the hudson river and the upper west side lovely subtle green decor and room large for nyc standards it was great having the living area with the lounge that converted into a double bed for our 2 children 12 and 14 kitchenette was handy to eat breakfast in we did cook a few evening meals but were limited with cutlery the fairway market across the road from the hotel was fabulous it had an amazing variety of produce as well as ready cooked meals having the laundry on the 7th floor was extremely handy us175 per load and you could get change from the front reception the staff and front doormen were all very friendly and helpful next to the lift is an info desk where you could get a map of nyc we used this map for the subway streets and main attractions as these were all on it good bottle shop next door to hotel as well
our first stay on the upper west side and cant say enough good things about the hotel beacon we stayed here based on reviews of family friendly hotels im not sure exactly how they are more family friendly than any other hotel except for the suites and kitchenettes for budgetconscious families there werent any special programs for kids but we did see other families there for nyc a nice sized queen suite gave us everything we needed didnt use the kitchen for our overnight stay but definitely would in the future rooms were comfortable ok a little tight at the foot of the bed but not like some complaints described the amenities were really appreciated eg free wifi keurig coffee service in room desk area energy efficient rooms you put your room card in a device that controls the electricity to save energy while youre out lovely bathrooms although they need a hand towel holder but really comfortable we are a family of 3 so the kiddo slept on the pullout sofa room was in good condition it appears that shade of green must be the theme but its nice the bellman held our luggage after checkout to allow us to stay in the city and not have to worry about our bags parking garage is right around the corner  very close viand diner downstairs was ok for dinner  not great but sufficient friendly front desk folks were really helpful  have breakfast at bagel talk not too far away very convenient to american museum of natural history  easy to catch a cab or subway we will definitely stay here again and very happy to recommend
great room very big with huge bed great location just one blocks walk from 72nd subway then 5 minute ride to times square and anywhere you want to go from there we had a room on the 24th floor so great views of san remo building and central park but building sways alot in windy weather very weird at first very close to central park check out cafe viand for sit down breakfast and fairway and levain bakery for take away breakfast great all in all
we stayed at this property in october for a week had a king suite which really was a suite with sitting roomkitchenette bedroom and bath the room was at the rear of the building which might have been a problem on lower floors the air shaft was below us however we were on the 10th floor and had a decent view to the east overlooking rooftops television in both rooms the staff was very friendly and helpful the market across the street was handy for breakfast items and snacks only a couple short blocks to the 72nd street subwaystation where you can pick up the 12 and 3 trains we had previously stayed at a hotel further north but nice as it was with accompanying prices it cannot compare with the beacon for value definitely recommended
this was our first stay at the andaz lovely little hotel with great views of the library very spacious with a huge bathroom the complimentary drinks and snacks were a plus very quiet my only complaint was there was no one to help us with bags or getting a cab we had quite a bit of luggage and no one was around to open the door at the entrance which consists of 2 black doors that are also not marked we wandered around a bit before realizing this was the main entrance we needed to get a cab to the train station and were told that none were available and that we should try and walk to madison ave to get one no easy feat with lots of luggage and it was quite the walk clearly they should have the means to summon a cab hopefully this will be addressed before our next visit
i was lucky enough to use my hyatt two free nights to stay at this hotel in early december went with my adult daughter and we stayed in a corner room with two twin beds on the ninth floor its tough to find good hotels with two beds in a room in nyc so this was a bonus the room was very quiet i could not hear anyone from other rooms the hallway or any street noise the room has a sleek modern design and was spacious for nyc standards i loved the bathroom being able to get a cold bottle of water at all times was great and snacks in the rooms was a nice touch i also loved the overall vibe of the hotel small hip clean and friendly great artwork not warm and cozy though the seating in the lobby is not particularly comfortable or inviting the staff was young and not as experienced as one would find at a fivestar hotel but this is not a fivestar hotel they did the best they could to help with restaurant reservations shopping information and other general information easy walk from here to grand central station to hop the subway and cabs easy to find loved being across from the new york pubic library and bryant park lovely popup stores and ice skating in bryant park for the holidays beats the craziness of rockefeller center in my book  there are a few problems that i believe can be corrected easily one is the lack of proper lighting in the room the architect and designers clearly were not thinking of women when they designed the rooms it is very dark and would be really difficult if you were trying to get ready for a special event also there is no drawer space and the closet is minuscule not sure how to correct that issue the other problem is that the beds at least the twins we slept in were not very comfortable very firm which is fine if you like it that way all in all though my memories are of a great stay
other hotels in nyc that are space challenged would do well to take note of what hyatt has done with its two andaz properties here not only is the 5th avenue property in a great location but the rooms are wonderfully designed and well appointed and the staff does a great job in terms of customer service my wife and i arrived at 10am on a saturday morning and the hotel had been sold out the night before however the young lady checked us in quickly and asked for a phone number to call us when our room was ready we went out to have breakfast and before we were finished she call to let me know that the room was ready we also loved the complimentary snacks and beverages in the mini frig as well as in the lounge the only drawback is that the internet is painstakingly slow which is the reaso for the 4 stars except for that the hotel is a 5 all around would definitely recommend highly
id never heard of this hotel but came away a big fan it is a boutiquestyle hotel with a european feel staff always ready to serve and yet laidback and friendly the location on fifth avenue was walking distance to most of the sights we wanted to see perfect the rooms and bathroom were modern and beautifulwe had a suite with a little kitchen minibar set up with complimentary espressomaker juices etc and loved the complimentary wine in the evening it was such a great stay and such a beautiful hotel and everyone on staff could not have been nicer thanks for all you did to make our trip to new york special…we loved every aspect of the andaz experience and we will definitely be back
just returned from a 4 day3 night long weekend in nyc with wife and two late teenage sons we stayed at the setai and loved it the rooms are surprisingly large for ny and beautifully appointed all the staff were outstanding in their courtesy and helpfulness and the location is pretty good too a few tips  we all preferred to take breakfast in our rooms for some reason it was just a better experience than the restaurant  do use the concierge for tickets restaurant and visitor recommendations everything they suggested worked perfectly and they enhanced our stay hugely  dont be afraid to walk and when i say walk i mean stroll take your time look around and youll be surprised how easy it is to get to places on foot empire state building is insanely close by madison square garden a short walk beyond that rockerfeller center broadway and times square make an easy and fun circular route and you can stroll up 5th avenue to central park and beyond quite easily  subways are a nightmare to find if youre used to the clear signposting in london or paris but once you done it once or twice youll get the hang of it the setai is no more than a block or two in any direction from the subway  taxis are a law unto themselves you have been warned sothe setai is just about as good as you can get in midtown and every one of us would go back in an instant if we could enjoy
just had four wonderful nights at this hotel door men mike  joe through to the manager brian all great people and really know how to make a guest feel welcome simply cannot do enough for you the bar on ground floor great fod and try the local beer unfortunately the bar on the second floor needs to take some lessons on how its managed as service was awful and staff only became busy and helpful when you asked for the bill  obviously wanting a tip  this was the only part of the whole hotel that a member of staff did not get a tip 
stayed at the setai for a special company program the hotel is beautiful modern clean the rooms are very large for a manhattan standard the bathroom is simply astonish the hotel is on fifth avenue one block from the empire state building
yes the hotel if great the rooms and bathroom are really lovely the bar is wonderful the staff are friendly and the service pretty much impeccable but at nearly £400 a night for a view of other walls and windows it aint cheap i think i got the hes booked through expedia so lets give him a really nice room with a really poor view treatment not a huge problem as i spent most of the weekend exploring their location cant be faulted and nor can the friendliness of the staff and the quality of the service they also let me have a late checkout on a sunday afternoon  a sign of a hotel that is truly focused on service in my opinion  my thanks to them overall its a great place to stay in ny
a very bad experience the entrance is narrow and uncomfortable and the doormen dont always open the door for you you have to walk a few steps and get into a hall which is essentially a bar so noisy during happy hours that you have to scream to be able to talk to the receptionist i was given a room on the 9th floor with an annoying noise in the air conditioning system i changed room and given another one with the same problem and an extremely narrow window looking into a shaft i was promised a better room the following day but when i checked the following morning the lady at the reception said that no room was available and the person i had spoken to was not on duty at the time i was told to check again later and i responded that if no other room was available i would check out i got back and after unpleasant negotiations with a manager i was promised a better room for the following day i went to my room thought about it a few minutes went back down and said i would check out at that point i was told that since it was by then past noon i was to pay for the room anyway upon my protest i was allowed to check out without paying for the additional night incidentally the rooms are dark the furniture is pretentiously stylish but in reality of very poor design and covered with dark brown plastic material the pool is a joke the size of four bath tubs finally there is no quiet area where you can just sit down in an armchair and chat with a friend in my view the place is grossly overrated
i loved this hotel and couldn’t believe how much money and effort went into the rooms great bath builtin cabinetry automated lighting and drapes and lots more superb service tasty but expensive drinks at the bar and a terrific times square location make the chatwal hard to beat recently it seems room prices have become very high unfortunately
i stayed at the chatwel on a layover in nyc travelers can always trust a luxury collection hotel to deliver great service comfortable accomodations and quality products the chatwel in midtown manahatten is no acception the staff was very hospital and could not do enough to make sure i was comfortable i received my normal upgrade as a platinum member and the bell cap enjoyed giving me the tour of the suite room features that are becoming standard in high end luxury hotels are all there including the in mirror tv and heated bathroom seats made for a nice touch  if you like midtown and can afford this hotel it is great have a meal at the lambs club resturant and gaze at all the historic photos of days gone by and the starts of broadway that used to frequent the joint
arrived to eventi in the evening from montreal we were at the 21st floor and had a great view to the esb full window from floor to ceiling and the surroundings easy access to everything we were mostly walking and took the hoponhopoff tours for further site loved the esb visit but would not recommend the ride a bit cheesy touched with the visit to the 911 memorial site best thrill was still the skating time on the rockefeller rink with all the xmas decoration  would definitively recommend the train ride between mtl and nyc take a lot of reading material and games and the accomodation in nyc eventi has modern and confortable room with all the services including the gym the staff was helpful and pleasant price was reasonnable for nyc
i planned a surprise trip to the city for my girlfriend to go see the tree the rockettes etc i made the best travel decision i have ever made by choosing the eventi not only did they have a bottle of champagne in the room for our big weekend but at every turn they were respectable and completely accommodating everyone at the front desk was superb and we were treated like royalty service aside our room had very large windows a rain shower and was in full view of the empire state building
we got a reasonable for nyc rate  330 with free wifi 15 from minibar which equals about 2 items its a little far from the theatre district but very central and easy access to the subway the lobby offers hot coffeeteacocoa in the morning and 2 newspapers wsj  nytimes the fitness area is more than adequate we preferred quiet to a view so rooms facing west were very quiet the rooms do have plenty of outlets for computers charging phones etc and good video connections to the flat screen tv to allow viewing our own video through ipads computers for those techies good environmental controls we like a cool room large shower no tub and a firm bed yes the area is not trendy or cute but if one can get a good rate this is a very attractive hotel
the eventi a boutique hotel at sixth avenue and 30th street is part of the kimpton chain and is typically attractive with a pleasant helpful staff the room was exceptionally quiet but the neighborhood is pretty dreary  not unsafe but unattractive convenient only to penn stationmadison square garden and in the middle of a retail district offering cheap wholesale handbags and jewelry next time ill choose a better location
stayed at this hotel while in nyc hotel is clean cosy and welcoming with a classic decor staff are also welcoming and friendly the location is also hard to beat being close to broadway the subway and reasonably close to central park price seemed reasonable for the location but the room was a bit smaller than what we would have liked couple  6 yr old and with three suitcases we had to place one on the floor near the door since there was no where else to put it prices for food and services seemed a little steep not sure how they compare with other hotels in the city but we found a diner only a few doors down which had good food at good prices hotel would suit a couple who only intend to use it as a base and dont intend spending much time there but being in nyc thats not hard to do a positive experience overall
perfect loacation for theater times square and radio music hall the place was very clean and the hotel staff was very friendly and helpful only complaint the resturant is overpriced we paid over 60 for 2 bowls of oatmeal 2 orders of toast 1 yougart coffee and tea with 20 tip our breakfast was 7801 better choice the red flame on the same block
i arrived around 830 pm calling ahead to tell the hotel when to expect me and found no doorman and no help with luggage to unload or go up the steps with my bags a stranger did it for me once checked in an employee decided to show me to the room with me trailing along with my luggage and holding the door to the elevator for him i finally told him to take the luggage once in the room i was told that i was not allowed to adjust the temperature of the room on the thermostat when i asked about the window heatingac unit he proceeded to fiddle with it i told him to be sure that it was off he lied and said it was off it was not off i later had to get the engineer to turn it completely off as the prior employee had activated a timer that was cycling it on and off there is no lighting in the closet or for that whole end of the room where i was attempting to unpack i took the minimum out of my bag for fear of losing the other things in the dark all wall plugs are completely filled with the hotels stuff i had to get down on my hands and knees to find a strip plug underneath the desk for my ipad to charge then i found an outlet on the side of the desk for my iphone to charge however to my dismay the next morning i found that when i turned off the desk light the desk plug also went dead and my phone did not charge overnight the mattress was good and that is why this hotel received three stars instead of two now the shower i scalded my right arm turning off the shower because there are absolutely no markings on the shower as where hot cold or off is i recommend that you step outside the tubshower before turning it off and be sure not to have any part of you under the water when turning it off there is no ventilation in the bathroom therefore not only was the bathroom completely steamed which ruined my hair but also the bedroom windows as to the socalled bay window in my room the top half of the windows is completely blacked out by the hotel eliminating half the light coming in the windows and this room really needs more light in addition there are dark brown wooden shutters that cannot be lifted only tilted that further curtail light entering this room what a dismal swamp it is breakfast there was an argument about whether or not i was allowed to order the continental breakfast being first told no and later told yes and then there was the issue with the eggs even when i told them how many minutes to boil the eggs the cook could not do the eggs even half way cooked to wear i asked not a good situation in my opinion sleeping although the mattress was comfortable i had to wear earplugs and play a sound soother to sleep well when the neighboring room turned on its shower the water sound screamed and bubbled right at the headboard to my bed i checked out in the am for a conference stored my luggage at the hotel and was allowed to use the gym in the late pm to change my shoes for my trip home in the early evening i am attempting to be fair and point out the good too and finally when i noted some of the deficiencies to the person who originally escorted me to my room his answer was it is what it is now that i am safely at home i can laugh at this most ridiculous interpretation of customer service i have ever heard
our annual trip to nyc this year i selected the iroquois  look no further  its so perfect the friendliest staff ever nice size room  very clean  every night a member of staff brings you chocolates and a weather forecast for the next day allan the concierge is wonderful  very knowledgeable and gives his honest opinion  everwhere he suggested was great the location is perfect and doors away is the cutest little diner that serves a great brealfast cant wait to go again next year you can walk to all the great shops on fifth  and macys is also not too far away
my husband and i stayed here with our good friend while visiting nyc for a broadway show the san carlos hotel is conveniently located to many of the common tourist sites including times square and the theater district we were able to walk to most of the places we wanted to see while in nyc  the hotel staff was so nice and accommodating they let us keep our bags there before and after checkout so we werent burdened with them while walking the streets and doing some sightseeing  the front desk offered great advice for a restaurant that was only a couple of blocks away from the hotel and they made the reservation for us we stayed in a room with two queensized beds and i will say that the size of the room in general was very large compared to many other nyc hotels it was very clean and orderly the beds were very comfortable overall this hotel is a great value for the price great location wonderful service and very clean rooms
i stay in the city each quarter for work and we seem to try a different hotel each time the san carlos hotel had the best rate this time in the midst of the craziness with the holiday time and it was a nice place to stay my initial impression was not positive i stopped by early to see if i could check in before my meeting and the man at the front desk just seemed to want to chatand chatand chat 10 minutes later i was able to finally find out a room wasnt ready no problem but it didnt need to take that long when i finally checked in at 530 i was given a handicapped room which just had some interesting things in the bathroom otherwise the bed and pillows were very comfortable and i was impressed that the room had a small refrigerator in addition to the mini bar microwave and a drawer that contained plates and silverware that was a very nice touch it was quiet and had a comfortable bed so id stay again if the price was right
after alot of trawling for a fab place to stay this was perfect location walkable to times square 5th avenue and close to tube stations local people in the area friendly and fab bagel place on 3rd ave and funky rooftop bar directly across the road the darker style rooms were a blessing for resting and the breakfast is a nice touch that its free but as been said before dont worry if you miss it the staff are lovely and helpful and the rooms kept spotless the beds and pillows were fantastic along with the small bathtub to rest your feet it was good to have teacoffee fascilities in the room we would stay again if we are to come back to nyc ps the indian restaurant next door is also worth a visit
i stayed this time only one night at the san carlos hotel but it was already my fourth stay here so it starts with a greeted curb side by the doorman who took my suitcase right to the front desk the check in at the front desk staff was polite and professional but a little bit cold  the room was again really nice clean though unfortunately not the suite size i had experienced last timeswas realy an upgrade at that time it had a small sitting room with all what you needed in your room refrigerator coffee trousers ironexcellent location in mid manhattan good breakfast for ny standardsall included certainly youll see me back again for business and leisure
the information about the sherrynetherland is very misleading to begin with a wideangle lens was used to photograph the lobby and sitting area which together are nothing more than a hallway  furthermore an inroom kitchen is pictured among the hotel photos which lead me to believe that i could expect this amenity perhaps that was naïve of me but i was not mistaken in my understanding that a microwave oven would be available upon request at the time of booking therefore the derision with which the person on the desk met my query came as a shock she informed me that since i’d only booked a room and not a suite i couldn’t expect anything she went on to ask if i thought they had microwaves just lying around i requested that this rude xx look into the matter and 20 minutes later someone came with the oven this was my experience of their much vaunted concierge service  as to it being a “cherished boutique hotel” or a “luxury hotel” so described on the sherrynetherland website it was shabby and the décor in my room had nothing in particular to recommend it  then there are the elevator attendants a number of immigrant men who stand around with very little to keep them occupied they were a nice enough bunch and i’m glad they have work but they are somewhat redundant after all i can press a button in an elevator without any help  i’ve seen much better hotels that cost much less money who ever gave this place 4 ½ stars yes i realize that one pays for location and that i rented ‘only’ a room and not a suite but as a regular visitor to new york i am never staying at the sherry netherland again
we loved our stay at the sherry the accommodations were so wonderful  enormous beautiful room overlooking central park and close to the subway and great eating and shopping spots and the staff was flat out great it had been a long while since we had been to nyc they helped us regain our subway prowess helped with tickets and they were very accommodating friendly and professional i hope we have an opportunity to stay there again soon
i stayed at the sherry during my last 4day business trip to nyc the location was great  right across from the plaza hotel the apple store and a stones throw to the beautiful shops on fifth avenue when i arrived i was greeted by a friendly concierge the elevators are operated by whiteglove elevator attendants which felt like a little treat every time i went up or down my room was everything a girl could want on her first business trip to nyc  a dressing room  with a plush white robe and ample space to hang things a keurig coffee maker with unlimited coffee pods a chandelier fresh bouquets of flowers boxes of godiva chocolates and a welcome card from the hotel manager every morning i ordered room service from ciprianis the restaurant attached to the hotel the omlette was delicious and filling out my breakfast form the night before and hanging it on my door knob quickly became a ritual  one evening the neighbours were making quite a lot of noise and i called down to the concierge at midnight within 10 minutes someone was upstairs to check on the situation and shortly thereafter things quieted down similarly when i couldnt get the wifi to work the concierge offered to send up an it person to help me figure it out the staff was attentive and although they had a bit of that brusque ny attitude different from what canadians are typically used to they were extremely helpful in the evenings someone would come to turn down the bed and leave little godiva chocolate squares throughout the room they would tidy up the newspapers and clothes in my room and make sure it looked warm and cozy for when i got home i loved it and would not hesitate to go back again
my sister and i decided to meet in nyc and chose the sherry for its excellent location rooms are vary large especially for a ny hotel and nicely decorated room service was expensive but excellent quality the business center is small but adequate but what really makes the hotel is the service everyone was welcoming and accommodating and went out of their way to help from the front desk people to the elevator operators to the room service guy
we go to new york every year and this is where we stay every time the people who work here are so friendly the hotel is beautiful and clean it is always very quiet i love that there is a market across the street and there are many great places to eat and have drinks nearby
we stayed in the hotel beacon for a week in late october and found it to be a very good hotel the rooms are very large  we were on the tenth floor  and had a kitchenettelounge and a bedroom and three walkin wardrobes  the staff were very friendly and helpful and the location was great  handy to central park  a short walk down to the hudson  the 72nd street train station was just a short walk away and the best feature of the area was the fairway market  everything you could want in the way of foodgroceriesdrink is at your fingertipsright across the road and the little restaurant upstairs does a great breakfast and a really good latte  we used the laundrette in the hotel and it was clean and well lit  what more could you want this is a family hotel  nice and quiet with a relaxed air about it we will definitely stay here again
stayed here for 4 nights in december it is a great hotel based in the upper east side 5 minutes walk from central park the staff were friendly and helpful we stayed in a 2 bedroom suite which was very affordable and perfect for our family of four the kitchen was an added bonus as there is a supermarket across the way where you can get a wide range of food
my partner and i stayed here from 6th december  10th december and had one of the best holidays ever the beacon hotel was a fantastic place to stay with friendly and polite staff who could not do enough for you the rooms were modern spacious and clean and the beds were heaven after a long day walking around manhattan the area of the hotel was ideal for us as it allowed us to see many of the new york attractions whilst keeping away from the hustle and bustle that many midtown hotels would experience the hotel itself is about a 10 minute walk from central park however a 3040 minute walk to many midtown attractions eg rockafella centre i would advise the city bus tour which was 54 dollars per person as it allows you to see all of the main tourist attractions and helps you find your bearings especially first timers our overall experience of the beacon hotel and new york as a whole is 10 out of 10 i could not recommend the hotel enough
having stayed there during huricane irene i agree this was 2011 the staff really helped us out on numerous subjects changing flights transportation meals and laundry while the city closed down etc rooms were excellent and attached which fitted our family needs very well location is hard to beat would go there again
a word to the wise and select your room carefully here we had a loft room on the 8th floor half of the room is an office it really is an office which they did inform us at check in the room is really only appropriate for a single business traveler only one drawer in the room so i used the office to lay out my suitcase and lived out of the that bathroom was roomy and the bed very comfortable decor is japanese sensibility meets european minimalism the controls for the shower were very challengingno kidding city noise does filter innot bad but bring ear plugs just in case this bothers you for the most part the staff was very helpful and friendly and attentive the food here is just excellent breakfast and room service i would eat here even if i was not staying here entrances dining areas lounges are not well marked so you have to guess your way around for a bit location is excellent very close to grand central station and tons of eating and shopping options i would definitely stay here again but would be more discriminating about the choice of room lastly an observation and not a complaint no holiday decorations to be found here in the midst of december
first stay at the andaz and i was quite impressed walk distance to some attractions like times square empire state building top of the rock grand central station etc the location is amazing the rooms are really modern minimalist type decor and very clean stylish and spacious bathroom mini bar included except for the liquor the staff was amazing specially jenny rodriguez from concierge who helped us a lot before and after our stay  my only issue was the lack of wardrobe or closet other than that highly recommended ill definitely stay here again
3 things i like  the best hotel i ever stayed in nyc the room is very nice the bed very comfortable modern and stylish you can get a good rate if you book well in advance  great location  very friendly staff 3 things i dont like  no loyalty program  no ihome for my ipod  the room has no view
the hotel was beautiful and the staff was so friendly and helpful after a few great recommendations from the concierge and some great meals and nights out we decided to stay in our last night and were delighted to have amazing food great live jazz and incredible service sarah at the bar served us a specialty cocktail from the menu and its now one of my favorite drinks i just hope my bartender at home can make them as well as she did
i absolutely loved this hotel very clean beautiful rooms and a welcoming staff special thanks to the reservation manager deryk he has been extremely helpful before and throughout our stay i will definitely come back to this hotel whenever i travel to new york and i will without any hesitationbook through deryk and i highly recommend anyone who books with this hotel to do the same amazing and professional service the hotel is a great location it has spacious rooms and very comfortable beds love love love
for a recent business trip to ny one of my colleagues recommended this hotel as he always stays here the location is great if you are a tourist and happily was within a short walk of the client i was visiting having checked in during the evening and out again at 730am i cant really comment on the facilities however there was no room service menu in my room no hotel facilities directory and no breakfast card this would have annoyed me if i had been staying longer the room was quite small but the bathroom was well appointed and the shower was great id stay here again on business but wouldnt take my husband as he likes to have a bath as well as a shower
delayed check in computers were down entered a dark gloomy room to a horrible musty odor had a quick lunch in resaurant before a showthe food was inedible overly salted and greasyrequested soymilk for my coffee that curdled as i poured it the waiter said their brand does that pour it slowly and stir brisklyneedless to say i didnt take his advise besides the coffee was so stong that it tasted like acidexpected much more from a top chef restaurant geoffrey zakarian where are you i have never written a review before i must let you all know that if you choose to stay here you are not in for a treat its all bad
my wife and i stayed here for 4 nights during thanksgiving the hotel is in a great location close to all the shops theatres times square  restaurants the food is really good and the rooms very spacious for new york the bathrooms are fabulous with tvs fitted into the mirrors heated toilet seats and jucuzzi baths the rain shower is one of the best i ever had the beds are very comfortable and the art deco style furniture has been well thought out and is of exceptional quality give the pool a miss its only about 15 ft long the photos on the website are very flattering i would definitely return here
great staff we stayed at the eventi the first week in december a particularly hard week to find a hotel in nyc from the moment we checked in we made friends with the staff they were friendly and fun and extra nice to my 12year old son they recognized us each time we walked in and out which made things really great the great thing that we noticed is that the staff really liked each other and seemed to have a lot of fun working there we particularly loved the restaurant manager tim who took great care of us and was so funny and attentive to us  oh and it was my birthday so they nicely left us a note and some cupcakes in the room which was great the room was not super big but i guess this is nyc ours had 2 queen beds and not much room for anything else the one negative was that it was rather dimly lit even when we turned on every last light but from what i understand this is a green hotel and they are saving on energy and wattage however we would have liked to have the room a bit brighter since there was also a lot of woodwork and dark closet doors which also made the room on the dark side even during the day the beds were extremely comfortable with nice white fluffy duvet comforters and down pillows there were a lot of outlets and close to the bed and located on the nightstands which were great for charging phones and computers we were on a high floor with nice views the rooms with two beds dont face the empire state building which was a bummer because we hoped to see it from the windows the hotel is centrally located and we walked from penn station and walked to bryant park which is beautiful around christmastime the 2nd floor restaurant has a glass ceiling and is open to the sky which is beautiful at night and from what i understand the roof retracts which would be awesome on a summer night which they said they do  overall we had a great stay
having stayed at the ink 48 a few years ago on returning to nyc i figured to try another kimpton hotel so full of expectation and a hard act to follow i arrived at the hotel and i was not disappointed there we a few hiccups but they got resolved in a timely manner by the hotel staff that was even after i return back to the uk the hotel itself if in a great location a couple of blocks from the subway and stones throw from a shopping haven  the room was big with lots of space all the things you need in the room tv ipod dock and a really comfy bed i would of taken this home if i could of fitted it in my case  lots of power sockets for charging phones etc staff are really attentive and friendly and want to ensure that your stay if perfect the wine hour is always worth a visit even ten after a longs day sightseeing and shopping
just returned to the uk following a 4 night stay at the eventi we were impressed from the moment we walked in  excellent check in efficient and friendly staff we went for my 30th birthday and i was given a little present at check in a big thank you to neville who sent champagne cupcakes and chocolates up as a special treat  what a lovely touch  hotel location is fantastic very close to the empire state  fantastic views from the hotel we requested a room with a view and they didnt disappoint we were given a room on the top floor with brilliant views across the city its around a 10 min walk to times square and very close to the subway station lots of nice restaurants and delis close by  wine hour was marvellous we were really impressed and the bar and atmosphere was delightful just what you need after a long day sightseeing  recommend tonys restaurant off times square if youre looking for a brilliant meal at reasonable prices the portions are enormous without skimping on quality the steak special outdid us dont think we even ate half  loved this hotel really really impressed and will definitely go back oh and the comfiest bed i have ever ever slept in
i loved my stay at the iroquois it was convenient to lots of spots in new york city and the hotel staff was extremely nice and helpful the elevator in the hotel is a little slow but we stayed on the 3rd floor and took the stairs they had the best complimentary coffee in the lobby in the morning and the best hot apple cider in the evening we hung out in the lobby and the library sipping our apple cider in the evening it was nice to sit and talk to other people staying at the hotel the hotel had a very home like feel and i would definitely stay there again new york city is an amazing place i really wish i lived there
the iroquois is a beautiful hotel i chose it because of its location to times square  5th avenue and because it also got good reviews here the staff were very professional and always had a smile the room was clean and cozy our suite 1000 had the most amazing view of rockefeller centre also the windows open nice and wide which was good because the hotel has that stuffy old hotel air which gives it its charm but also makes it hard to sleep at night of course opening the window makes it louder than normal i brought earplugs if you are a light sleeper bring earplugs to new york  my husband thought the room was a little small but i thought it was just right when your on a quick 4 dayer you dont spend any time in it anyway it had a tv dresser draws a little fridge a good sized bathtub shower and a desk with chair pretty standard  unfortunately we did not eat in the hotel restaurant but a lady in the elevator told me that it was great within a 5 block radius there are plenty of restaurants and irish pubs which happen to be my favourite so the hotel ammendities were not that important to me on this trip there is a good reasonably priced family style restaurant at the end of the block called the red flame great breakfast diner restaurant for its price  as i mentioned the hotel is close to everything dont kid yourself though if you are in new york to see the sights you will be walking alot bring good shoes the hotel conceirge was fabulous when it came to giving us directions especially subway lines so dont worry about having to navigate it all by yourself  thumbs up iroquois we will be back
my husband and i stayed for the long weekend after thanksgiving this was our first stay at the iroquois hotel we loved it the staff was friendly and the room was as described it was one of the cleanest rooms we have ever stayed at the bathroom was updated and wonderful we received a free breakfast with our reservation it was great the orange juice was fresh squeezed and delicious the basket of pastries were fresh and the fruit was freshly cut our waiter was very nice and made sure we had everything we needed we would surely stay here again
i love the san carlos the rooms are exceptionally clean with great amenities the staff was wonderfully attentive without being overbearing they went the extra mile to make me feel comfortable and give idiot proof directions to this tourist the quiet elegance of the hotel was comforting against the hustle and bustle of the city
we stayed at the san carlos for 5 days over thanksgiving and it was just perfect the rooms are large for nyc standards very easy access convenient location clean and confortable rooms no luxuries but well kept
my husband collegeage son and i stayed in the executive suite at the san carlos hotel for the second time this year were ex nyers and appreciate the convenience of the location the executive suite is perfectly designed for 2 or 3 people it features a pullout sofa in a sitting area as well as a small kitchen so handy the linens and appointments are top notch the rooms are spotless and comfy the room includes a buffet breakfast the staff is the best
i was surprised when the owner of the hotel presented to me and my family last january he said its good that the boss pay attention to you effectively the attention of the hotel is good the rooms are clear and clean you feel confortable in the middle of town next to the train the museums and the big avenues of new york
we recently stayed at the sherry with my husbands parents  for my father in laws 80th birthday our suiterooms were amazinginly spacious for nyc charming and comfortable the hotel was clean quiet and the staff were all very friendly and helpful the hotel offers more of a residence feel than a standard hotel and the locations is unbeatable  across the street from central park in the heart of fifth avenue shopping and within walking distance to rockfeller center and times square if you enjoy walking we found the hotel quiet and a terrific place to relax in the evening after exploring the city all day and night we only used the fitness facility once because the weather is perfect for jogs in central park instead but did find it a bit small and outdated compared to other high end hotels room service is available at cipriani downstairs and we used it for breakfast which was good  although the breakfast cutoff hours and staff at cipriani were not ideal  no fault of the sherry though as they are not under the same management and operate independently we loved our stay at the sherry overall and hope to be back soon
great staff best location and old world charm we love the sherry just across the street from the park and if you are up for walking a walk to and from the theatre my husband and i did it and we are in our 50swe will definitely be back
location location across the road from central park and walking distance to many attractions with character and old world charmthankyou mr louis sherry for founding such a beautiful hotel beautiful decor and the rooms are well furbished with antiques and chandeliers we were lucky enough to be upgraded to a suiteabsolutely fabulous apartment living in the best locale in townlounge dining kitchen and bedroom with plenty of closet space and a glorious bathroom staff were very helpful very friendly fabulous service the king room in which we started was also a reasonable sizenice decor with small bathroomstill value for money considering the location which is the most outstanding feature and benefit central park to escape to and breathewith many attractions within near or around the parkstrawberry fields walk trails the lakes zoo and gardens plus perimeter shopping and museum mile and much more subway on the cornerand a fifth avenue addressuptown living at its best overall oustanding sherry netherland
we stayed in the city one bedroom suite during our short trip to nyc very much enjoyed the incredibly spacious suite the beautiful views of nyc and great interior design and architecture of both rooms and hotel the suite was really very spacious and comfrotable with huge spa bathroom it was a pleasure to relax there after days spent throughout the city we really enjoyed the accomodation the suite includes also small kitchenette according to the information provided to us at the time of reservation the refrigerator shall be stuffed with selection of nonalcoholic beverages and the reality two non sparkling bottles of water if i wanted to have some coke it was necessary to use room service it was not overpriced but still very annoying and the promise given has not been fulfilled the other negative aspect was that we were not provided with advantages as lhw members except for thenice personal letter from the manager usually we receive at least some fruits uograde free internet or something the last negative point was about pre arrival assistance and concierge we sent some requirements before our arrival but got answer only very late as our email was categorized as spam and the concierge had not chcecked the spam folder we also had some difficulties with our reservation when in the city and were not able to reach the concierge via phone we succeeded only after 15 minutes and sixth call  one great tip about the hotel no checkout time limit pretty good despite small negative issues we very much enjoyed the stay and can honestly recommend the hotel to others
from the first night we stayed at this hotel both my husband and myself have been itching like crazy we stayed an unfortunate four nights at this hotel and suffered major itching including a major let down from what we were advised before booking at the chatwal we phoned prior to booking to ensure that the hotel had bathtubs as our personal preference we only book with hotels which have bathtubs  we were advised that every room has a bathtub  excellent so we booked we arrived all the way from new zealand 19 hours of flighttime at approximately 1100pm to arrive to a major disappointment no bathtub we phoned the desk from our room and were advised sorry theres nothing we can do as all rooms with a bathtub are taken we then advised that prior to booking we were advised that all rooms have a bathtub  no sorry you were told wrong and theres nothing i can do but you are welcome to leave then my husband went downstairs and spoke to the duty manager who then finally relented and looked up to see who would be checking out the following morning so we could get a room with a bathtub we were then promised a room with a bathtub by 1200 midday but by the next morning the woman at the desk advised sorry but they are now checking out at 400pm so we asked for a refund for the first day since the whole inconvenience had ruined a whole entire travel day we had been trying to sort out this mess ourselves all night long and the following morning by arranging a room with a bathtub  their reply sorry theres nothing i can do  she didnt even offer any complimentary gestures as a way of saying sorry for the inconvenience caused by this ridiculous hotel we would have loved to have checked out and moved to another hotel however upon such short notice and only arranging three days in new york time was very restricted this hotel is perfect for backpackers who have money the hotel is so small and running on a strictly cheap budget that there is no doorman in the morning upon checkout it has been two days since we checked out and yes we are still itching like crazy this hotel does not guarantee to deliver
my bf and i go to new york quite regularly and this time choose the chatwal hotel we have stayed in the w waldorf ritz etc and the service is excellent this is truly a boutique hotel with it being a smaller property but dont let that turn you off as the service is custom tailored when getting out of the taxi we had our bags taken care of right away and directed towards the check in counter we had no problems at check in and received a complimentary room upgrade which was a pleasant surprise from that moment on after check in to our departure all the staff were attentive and knew our names or took the time to introduce themselves one of the most memorable was when in the elevator and brandon took the time to talk to my bf about his glasses and how he had the same one as previous posters have said the rooms arent super big but this being nyc this was expected but the room was gorgeous leather closet doors that looked like trunks an excellent bar area and a comfortable big bed the bathroom is amazing while there was no bathtub the shower made up for it as it was very large and the toilet was quite neat with all these japanese style options the amenities provided were also excellent we also used the butler service to have our shoes shined and clothes pressed before dinner had a chance to use the pool and gym facilities which were adequate but they were working with the space they had the location was very close to times square so that was convenient but isolated so the noise and traffic would not affect your stay our four night stay was quite pleasant however you get what you pay for and the chatwal is pricey was it worth it i would say yes because of the excellent service and the upgrade thank you chatwal for our excellent stay and will definitely consider you again for our destination hotel in nyc
my wife and i stayed in four hotels in our recent trip across the us and this was our favourite the location is great and was one of our key reasons for choosing eventi we arrived by train into new york penn and its only a short 5 min walk to the hotel being located on 6th avenue at 30th street means youre pretty central for the typical tourist area the empire state building is just around the corner and times square is a 10 min stroll north the hotel itself is very clean and modern in terms of the reception area and the rooms i was amazed everything looked brand new the room was very spacious with a generously proportioned bathroom the décor made the room feel very special and the bed was extremely comfortable the staff were very helpful and checkinout was a very swift process we paid £148 per room per night which is fairly pricey but i didnt feel like id been short changed the hotel and location were worth it my one issue with the hotel was the wifi access supposedly free but we never managed to get it working you have to fill in your details and wait for an email which gives you the necessary login details spot the big error here  how can i check my email if i dont have wifi 5 months later the email still hasnt arrived
after being in many hotels around the world there is no other place like the iroquois the staff cleanliness and comfort gets better with every stay we will definitely choose and recommend others to choose the iroquois as their midtown manhattan hotel we look forward to staying there again
lovely hotel in a great location the rooms are well appointed and definitely cozy  small but thats fairly typical for the age and location the hotel is right in the heart of the theatre district restaurants and shopping minutes from times square and an easy walk to central park the staff is very welcoming and concierge vanessa is knowledgeable and helpful
the sherry is my home away from home my business takes me there often i arrive with chocolates flowers and a hand written note from the management no request is denied there is a sense of old world service which at most hotels are a thing of the past well 5 star service is alive and well here
excelent hotel staff location and accomodations big nice and clean rooms and suites expectacular view to central park from rooms service was incredible if you ask something by phone concierge send someone that arrives to your room in less than two minutes to solve the problem i had never seen a fast and efficient service
was a experience to remember great place to stay and place to be for a visit while in new york city also look forward to going back in the near future and making the sherry netherlands hotel my honeymoon staybethe sherry netherlands hotel and staff made me and my lady feel very welcome to be therethank you all again
due to a lack of electric power from hurricane sandy and the ny marathon falling on the same weekend we couldnt get a room at the plaza pierre regent essex house etc my wife found a room at the san carlos hotel in midtown with only one night available we loved it the room was clean bright and more than ample they had a nice buffet breakfast included great staff
after 2yrs planning 3 friends and i left the husbands and kids at home in ireland and headed to nyc for 4 nights of relaxation sightseeing and shopping we arrived sat 27th and sandy arrived monday 29th so our nyc adventure became somewhat curtailed thanks to all the staff at san carlos we ended up staying for 3 extra nights at standrad rate  no profitering unlike stories we heard from other weary travellers and enjoyed all nyc has to offer before we departed the rooms are very spacious and spotless the suite was great for 4 ladies highly recommended
i recently stayed at this hotel with a friend of mine for four nights when we visited nyc we werent sure what to expect as we went off of reviews from here and viewed picturs uploaded by others on this website when we arrived the staff was very welcoming and took our bags up to our room the room and bathroom was very small however this was to be expected for nyc the location was amazing  it was a 4 min walk to times square the staff was very friendly and answered any questions we had including the fastest way to get to a particular place they also provided us extra pillows and towels when we requested them and bandaids for my friend who got blisters from walking all day the checkin and checkout was a very smooth process and did not take long at all  when we return to nyc we will be staying here again
my husband and i had a wonderful stay at eventi in new york it was a great locationand the staff is so professional and met our every wish the room is so comfortable from the bed to the little details love every detail the lights the outlets for phones and computers that are strategically placed and suprisingly we didnt hear the ny noise like many other hotels the wine hour was a nice touchcant wait to stay there again
we stayed here for two nights during a business trip the front desk and hospitality staff were very welcoming the room was a little small but not unexpected in ny sometimes it is the little things i loved the plugs in the night stands for my phone very clean nice television very comfy beds with tons of pillows i would stay here again
took a veterans day weekend trip to the chatwal for our anniversary we used our starwood points for the room little pricey but its a nifty hotel the lobby area is small but with gorgeous art deco interior of the lambs club restaurant is also really lovely its right off times square so location is good for most things rooms at the chatwal arent super big but this is nyc and this is a retro location so i didnt expect massive space what they lack in size they make up for in appointments the rooms are done up kind of like id imagine a 1920s cruise ship leather doors with leather handles kind of like old time steamer trunks lots of cubbies and efficient use of space cool bar bathrooms are awesome as others have mentioned the toilets have an unreal number of functionsbidet seat warmer air dry too many functions really but fun when youre on vacation our room was facing the alley so nothing great on the view but the room was nice enough that it didnt matter wish the bed had been a bit more comfy and higher off the floorall the beds seemed very very lowbut overall i was pretty happy with the space service was great as well free shoe shine and you have a butler who can handle things like pressing your suit or dress for dinner did have a bad situation which highlights the excellence of the service wed been given a room with a connecting door unfortunately next door were three single guys having a weekend in the city and the noise was unreal like they were standing right next to you talking in your ear while you were trying to sleep so we got to participate when they got room service at 2 am when they got up at 830 and then again when the maids came in to clean at 9 after the first night we complained to the desk and they gave us a new room we went out for the day and when we came back theyd packed all of our things and moved them for us and they were thoroughthey even found the charger my husband had left plugged into the wall so have to give them credit for the assist that said if you walk into your room and theres a connecting door and youre not with the people staying in the next room immediately get a new one you will hear everything overall i enjoyed it honestly i was probably expecting a little more for the level so i wouldnt say it exceeded my expectations but it was very nice my gold status didnt really get us much of anything so cant say starwood helped much other than to use the points its not inexpensive it was 30000 points plus per night and more than 700 if wed paid out of pocket not out of sync for this level in nyc but the st regis was on the same point level and i cant say i think its better than that  bottom lineif youre looking for something retro and cool its great if you need something more modern or a lot of space probably not for you
our first trip to ny city in a few years and the first time we stayed at the chatwal which we decided to stay in due to its proximity to broadway and a friends recommendation the hotel does not have a grand entrance however once inside its art deco style embraces you our room was upgraded on the basis we had to wait 10 minutes to check in it was not expected but welcome all the same as were the complimentary cocktails the room was superb and i cannot fault it the same with the bathroom the rain shower is the best i have experienced and my wife just loved the toto toilet which shall we say possesses many added extras to make your bathroom experience more entertaining finally the location we booked to see a broadway show and were there in less than two minutes its right in the heart of times square which offered numerous choices of eating and drinking establishments the chatwal is not cheap but worth every penny
amazing hotel this is the 3rd time i stay here the reservation manager deryk is so pleasant and kind and helpful he is one of the many reasons that i will be loyal to this hotel if you are planning a vacation to new york book through him the bathrooms are huge and clean and the beds are extremely comfortable very helpful staff who are always there to help definitely the only hotel i would stay at in new york
i arrived to the hotel greeted by warm welcoming employees my personal assistant helped me what whatever i need and when i say whatever i mean whatever they helped me get reservations at places that took months to get in on i also made a reservation for my husband and i at the spa in the hotel one of the best spas i have ever been to being that my husband travels a lot the staff at the spa jason and cynthia were welcoming relaxing made us feel like we made the right choice just off the welcome we got they did not rush us to fill out out paper work or to the treatment they made us a glass of wine just for it being our anniversary a few weeks ago to me that was amazing i would never expect such professionalism and kindness out of a spa before after our treatments we paid and they again wished us a happy anniversary and walked us down to the elevator pushed the button and contented to talk to us going above and beyond to make us feel at home here at the hotel i would stay at this hotel a million times and i will be recommending it to my friends and family thank you so much setai
we stayed here in may 2011 to attend a friends wedding my husband and i took a red eye from sfo and we planned on meeting my sister brother in law 5 month old nephew and their dog who had driven up from va we stayed in a two bedroom suite with views of the library bryant park empire state building and a glimpse of times square the location was superb we were within walking distance to my favorite nyc places including ktown central park and 5th ave  our suite was huge especially for nyc the bathrooms are sleek with co bigelow toiletries there was a kitchenette incluing a mini dishwasher all nonalcoholic drinks were included in the room rate since my husband is hyatt diamond breakfast for all four adults was included in the rate and we were able to have it delivered to our suite through room service the breakfast came from the restaurant downstairs  the shop and everything was delicious  the hotel is trendy and modern and yet it feels cozy the service was great
this hotel features beautiful bathrooms and stylish trendy decor unfortunately the rooms are uncomfortably furnished and almost useless to work or read in the furnishings chairs and desk are at a level about 4 inches below normal there is no comfortable chair or sofa on which to sit when in your room only the bed offers any true respite televisions are wall mounted flat screens but set only about four feet off the ground so unless you are in bed an adult generally would look down to the screen all in all very strange and completely unnecessary finally in the beautiful bath black mold was evident in the tile grout and was also on the shower wall although not obvious since it was obscured by the coloration of the tile
planned a long weekend last week in nyc arrived in hectic rush hour from jfk at the andaz 5th avenue and were welcomed in their slick hotel lobby and immediately upgraded upon checkin to a two bedroom suite with separate bathrooms and a livingroom which allowed for discrete privacy for all three travellers agree with the considered 5 service level hotel key amenities are  cool and chic design  central design  5th avenue opposite library and 2 blocks from grand central  nice restaurant with excellent breakfast á la carte menu  bar downstairs with good vibe for cocktails and tapas style food  small gym but with modern equipment
we enjoyed our stay at hotel beacon we got a 1 br suite which worked out fine for our group of 3 on a girls trip there is a fold out couch in the living room it was nice to have a refrigerator to store cold drinks leftovers and breakfast items the staff was very nice and responded quickly to requests for more towels etc the only issue we had was that one night there was a late concert going on at the beacon theater next door and from our room we could hear the music  the location is greatwe liked being in a neighborhood and love the treelined side streets and brownstone homes nearby in just a few blocks of walking less than 5 minutes you can be at a subway stop i would definitely recommend hotel beacon for all kinds of travelers
great hotel for new york kitchenette is a godsend and whilst small has everything you need our room was on 21st floor and we compromised some space and bed size we had initially been allocated 11th fl for a fantastic view and far more natural light room was cleaned daily and you can ask for extra kitchen things like sharp knife  wine glasses etc supermarket is just over the road we arrived on thanksgiving and got excellent service from the check in manager and kenny at the door was great other times it was not quite so good or pleasant and the information given out by the concierge regarding half tix booth downtown was incorrect we ended up wasting half a day travelling downtown which was closed due to sandy as a result not happy at all  otherwise all good  easy to get to subway walk to central park and mnh 10 cab ride tofrom pretty much all the other major attractions
my best friend and i went to nyc in august last year and spent 2 weeks at hotel beacon we booked the 1 bedroom 2 double bed room the room was huge very clean and we had a great view our room had a coffee machine which was restocked with coffee pods and creamer every day by the cleaning staff there is also a great restaurant next door the owner was very nice and makes an effort to greet his customers and remembers the ones who go back multiple times like us  my only complaints 1 i dont know if this was an issue with our room only  the bathroom didnt have any sort of ventilation so we had to shower with the door open or the whole room would steam up this wasnt a problem for us and wouldnt really be a problem for a couple but could get awkward if you were staying with your boss on a business trip 2 no complimentary wireless internet  for the amount of money we paid it would have been nice to have access to wifi even if we had to sit in the lobby or something to get it they have the option of around 10 per day to get wireless in the room or you could go to the computer room which only had 2 computers in it and it was always full  overall  a great hotel the staff were extremely friendly especially the door men who would happily stand and have a chat while we were waiting for a taxi the room was lovely and its in a great spot walking distance to times square or easy access to the subway for those who dont want to walk would definitely recommend it to friends and family 
our room was bigger than expected and quiet we loved the bed linens and the soaps and other toiletries which were of high quality appreciated the free bottled water friendly people great location in midtown
i was in houston on business and stayed at this best western from 123127 best experience on business travel i have ever had the staff at this location is phenomenal and extremely personable this best western location exceeded any expectations that i had if im ever in houston again i will be staying at this location
stayed 1 night in room 207  spacious well furnished room including microwave lots of parking available  not exactly “downtown” but a free shuttle service is provided to get into town which is convenient cheap cab ride back although it is walkable  guest selfservice laundry facilities provided  1 per load to wash and an extra 1 per load to dry there is only one washing machine and one dryer however other facilities include vending machines and the poolspa area appeared well maintained although we didn’t use it  breakfast is pretty basic and served with plastic plates and cutlery however it did the job they have “happy hour” in the afternoons where you get 2 free drinks and nibbles i was mortified though when my red wine was served cold some of the staff were helpful some not so much we had an issue with the prepayment of the room through a third party website which could have been dealt with better but overall this hotel is very good for a houston visit
the hilton americas is a very nice hotel that i will choose to stay in again the room was very clean fresh new stylish and very quiet the bed was very comfortable the towels were fluffy fresh and large the staff are all very friendly and helpful the executive lounge is very large and has great views of the downtown skyline the fitness center is great very large well appointed and also has great views the hotel is within easy walking distance of the convention center the toyota center shopping discovery green and groceries at phoenicia specialty foods
i had to work over the holidays and took my family with me since my trip was one week over thanksgiving this hotel was the best kim and jacques your caring attention to detail and desire to accommodate is beyond compare i have to admit i have stayed here before and had a couple of concerns but when i brought these to jacques attention they were corrected immediately the infinity pool and pool deck is amazing  boasts beautiful sunsets in the evening the hotel is close to shopping a large childrens park very nice restaurants and grocery shopping and eats at a wonderful spot called the phoenician sp that is in walking distance my family had a wonderful holiday away from home thanks to the hilton americas
this is a newer property and i stay here quite a bit when traveing to houston the lobby is clean the staff at the front desk have always been friendly they have a gym with several bikes elipticals etc the rooms are clean with flat screen tvs and the beds are comfortable ive only eaten at the restaurant during breakfast when they have the buffet they have a pretty good selection but maybe a little overpriced during breakfast during my last visit the waitress came by one time to bring coffee and i never saw her again until i had to track her down to bring the check they have a small bar with tvs in the restaurant area
the staff at this hotel makes it a excellent rating the hotel is decent with pleasent rooms and the kitchenette is very helpful for those of us who are here for a long period of time i must say that the staff though is supurb starting with the hotel manager latonya she goes above and beyond to make all of our stay here the best it can be this trickles down to the rest of the staff including all the front desk help to the maids as well as the maintance staff all eager to help if something occurs that is why i would stay at this hotel again
this hotel is a gem old world charm beautiful appointed rooms stunning location right across the road from central park and 10 minutes walk to times square 7 of us stayed in 3 rooms and all thoroughly enjoyed our stay
when you stay at the sherry netherlands all the staff do their utmost to make you feel at home the bellman the elevator operator the concierge  are very kind helpful and efficient  lovely room bathroom full of free amenities free softdrinks in your room   perfectly located on the corner of fifth avenue and central park  we will be back
my husband and i stayed at the sherry for two weeks and i wanted this “hotel” to be excellent as per the ratings on ta we had just come from two weeks at the greenwich hotel in tribeca which was fantastic the only reason this did not get a poorer rating is that the building is in a convenient location this was a reason we choose not to move you are right opposite central park with the horse and carriages and in short walking distance to all the main fifth avenue shops other positives were spacious bedroom heaps of wardrobe space free wifi free sodas that were refilled every day comfy bed plenty of bathroom amenities choice of newspaper heaps of tv channels and a coffee machine godiva chocolates were placed on our pillow at night which you do not see often nowadays there were a lot of old world touches rather than give you two weeks of examples of the poor service we received i will list just a few remembering we are paying 700 per night it was 635 and then you add all the taxes before i start with the negatives the reason for my heading is that sherry lacks a lot of services that a hotel has for example there is no lounge to go sit in read and watch the world go by there is no casual area to have a coffee or snack just a small lobby with a couple of chairs so if you are staying here for any length of time you are stuck in your room there is no pool to go sit by a previous reviewer stated that their stay was “odd” and now i understand why for two weeks i was able to watch how the staff treat the hotel guests versus the residents of the building and it is very different in fact we felt like we were imposing and intruding we did not feel like hotel guests the concierge’s were polite but they had this underlying tone and attitude  so we arrive at the sherry and are greeted by alvin who collects our bags we are checked in by the concierge and given a nice welcome until she looks at my passport photo and tells me how much i have aged now i just laughed it off however upon reflection this lady did not know me and is that appropriate behaviour from a five star hotel or maybe it is not a five star hotel it is a residential building and she became too familiar with us alvin takes us up to our room and we step out to renovations occurring on the second floor which is where our room is the concierge forgot to inform us of this when checking in alvin points out that the business centre is closed for renovation and lucky for us they have relocated it right next door to our room alvin shows us our room we tip him and he stated that he is a native new yorker and if we need anything he is around – we never saw alvin again until check out two weeks later when he picked up our bags there was a box of godiva chocolates and flowers welcoming us there were also two notes from the management both notes had different and incorrect spellings of my name my booking was made by my travel agent so they had all the details – oh and my surname only has four letters and my christian name is also very easy  i wondered about the renovations going on but at that time it was about 3pm in the afternoon on a weekday we could not hear any noise so unpacked and settled in we were happy in fact during the whole two week stay we did not actually hear much of the renovation going on it is what woke us up each morning as stated above there was board on the floor in the hall way stuck together by masking tape each night it was removed and every morning weekday it was relaid so between 800 – 830am you would hear the ripping of masking tape and while doing this the person laying the board would have a very loud conversation with the housekeeping staff or other tradesmen right near our room so rather than wake up naturally without fail we were woken by the staff of the “hotel” there were mornings on the weekend when i woke up to the housekeeping staff calling out to bring more towels or for a staff member calling for security on her walkie talkie my tip to the sherry if your guest has the “do not disturb” sign up and the paper is still outside their door it indicates they are still asleep the bathroom – it was small however we had a bath great i thought then i looked at the bottom of it the nonslip surface was fifty shades of grey there was no way i was sitting on that it needed to be replaced or given a damn good bleach this leads me into housekeeping extremely inconsistent if a hotel is renovating and it expects its guests to stay within the area during this phase then the housekeeping needs to be vigilant with keeping building dust to a minimum after about four days i noticed the build up of dust it is important to note here that there was a lot of drawers and wardrobe space so we did not leave a lot of personal items out on the side cabinets or tables the housekeeping did not have to move any personal items to dust by day five i was able to write words into the dust i wrote “hello” on the tv stand and it still did not get cleaned day seven it did only because i happened to be in the room at the time i am not sure if the bathroom got cleaned as there was a pubic hair on the daddo by the toilet and stayed there for the full two weeks with all the dust now there are plenty more examples to provide but the piece de resistance was room service we had been eating in a lot of restaurants and decided to stay in one night i said to my husband all i feel like is a toasted cheese sandwich he rings room service and orders one each we get our order – two plates with covers first thing we notice only one glass of water we laugh then we lift the lid and were shocked the toasted sandwich was that a cheese toasted sandwich not what you expect from a five star kitchen there was no parsley for decoration no fries no salad just plain crappy white bread with plastic cheese and the crusts cut off and it was very dry took a photo of it now you are probably saying yeah that is what you wanted yes but guess what we paid when i asked my husband what the amount was on the bill  4100 for two toasted sandwiches and one glass of water i would not have minded if we got some fries and salad with that in all my travels and i have been travelling most of my life that would go down as the worst hotel dish i have seen and the biggest rip off by the way based on this dish we did not even want to waste our time and money going to the restaurant  my tip if you are staying at the sherry go around corner to the deli we got beautiful sushi spicy crab for 575 also for the international visitors who may not know you can take your washing to a dry cleaner and they do it for you usually one pound of clothing costs about 100 we had 44 items of clothing washed and it cost 20 by the way i was happy to put all of this into a customer satisfaction feedback form but there was not one in our room so with this experience in mind go to a proper hotel a place that provides the amenities a hotel of five star standard should we certainly noticed the difference when we checked in at the peninsula in beverly hills after staying at the sherry – now there is a hotel oh and i checked what they charged for a toasted cheese sandwich  12 but you got ham with that and tomato soup plus a bread basket and two glasses of water i will say that fernando the doorman was extremely polite and very helpful
i enjoyed a twonight stay the san carlos hotel i was greeted curb side by the doorman who took my suitcase right to the front desk the front desk staff was terrific check in was easy and they upgraded my room  the room was really more of a suite it had a large sitting room with a refrigerator and wet bar the bedroom was comfortable with a nice king size bed with soft comfortable linens both rooms had flat screen tvs and a wide selection of channels the bathrooms were large by nyc standards nice appointments including nice fluffy towels the room was very quiet so i slept well  at 275 for the night i would definitely stay there again
we stayed at the san carlos hotel for two nights last month hotel was in a great location and the subway is around the corner room size was great for traveling with two kids pleasant front desk and housekeeping staff breakfast is fine  pleasantly surprised by the stoneyfield farms yogurtnice perk essabagel is around the corner if you want a true ny bagel no complaints would definitely consider a return visit when back in nyc
girls weekend that included tickets to see barbra streisand perform in brooklyn we were debating about a vacation rental vs hotel finally settled on the san carlos based on a recommendation what a great choice friendly staff and spacious room we rented an executive suite which was a living room bedroom and small kitchen complete with dishware mini fridge and microwave clean mostly quiet  hard not to heat street noise in nyc right bathrooms were an unexpected luxury 1 12 blocks to the subway  couldnt have been any more convenient close to times square and the theatre district and of course shopping i would definitely stay at the san carlos again
i come to ny regularly and always stay at the san carlos hotel as it has a rare combination of 1 top rooms that get the highest level of maintenance 2 staff  the nicest staff that never changes and always happy to assist the guests in any way they can 3 small but important things that better anybodys stay such as breakfast free internet biz center and more during sandy the hotel was ran in the most efficient way needed staff stayed over and was extremely nice to everyone given the numbers of ppl that walked in  for me as a frequent traveler theres only one hotel in nyc  the san carlos 
despite the rather nondescript frontage the iroquois is one of the best hotels we have stayed at in ny our room was excellent although the bathrooms are a little on the small side the staff are wonderfully friendly and helpful k but the best thing is the location a few minutes walk from times square overall a great experience and will definitely stay there again high praise to all of the wonderful staff who made us feel so very welcome
excellent in all respectsroom a bit small but thats manhattan concierge vanessa was delightful and got us great tickets to theatre tje little bar is cozy and has a vibe too clean and friendly and great locationa gem
we stayed at the eventi kimpton hotel for 7 nights at the end of november we would recommend this hotel the hotel staff are very helpful and provided us with local tips for eating and drinking in the area there is also good security at the hotel as in the evening there was always a security guard on the door the hotel room was a decent size very clean and the bed was very comfortable however we did find the lighting in our room a little dark the air conditioning was good especially as it was cold during our stay it was also nice that we were able to open the windows for some fresh air if needed the bathroom was well appointed  if you require a quiet room i would recommend asking for a room at the back of the hotel even though you do not get the skyline view of the empire state building you will have a better nights sleep as 6th avenue is always busy with traffic the location of the hotel is great  close to the empire state building shops and the subway most things are within a short walk if you do not want to use public transport there are also numerous bars and restaurants nearby  particularly in the flatiron district if you are a kimpton in touch member you receive free wifi for your stay and also a 15 gift card to use in the minibar the wine hour is a nice bonus however we only went once the hotel also offers complimentary tea and coffee in the lobby area in the morning  personally we would have preferred a coffee machinetea station in our room  overall a great stay at a great hotel
i am currently staying at the eventi during an adventurous business trip thats taking me from california to texas to dc and back again to new york having spent much of the past 2 years on the road worldwide i can honestly say that the service i have received here has been above and beyond nothing is too much trouble a rare and precious commodity to the well worn traveller in one word exceptional 
our room facing 44th street was a good size for a new york hotel near times square great location for theaters and even a short walk to the park small but adequate fitness center pool and hot tub shares the same space as the red door spa the staff was all very friendly and accommodating
i just returned from a 4 night stay at the chatwal service fantastic they met our every need and then some we were given an upgrade and had a spacious junior suite that was absolutely beautiful the bathroom is amazing 4 people could have fit in the shower the suite should have had a bathtub though for the price paid location is fantastic  we were there for theatres galleries and shopping and being near times square is fantastic the rooms were very quiet and we slept very well the staff is unfailingly polite and helpful i would happily stay here again
we checked into this hotel when our home lost electricity and heat post sandy the service was excellent and staff were very friendly and remembered our names right away the hotel was very accommodating to our needs we have a dog and a baby this is nyc though so the room is understandably small and a bit worn we redeemed spg points for the stay not sure if ita worth the rack rate
matt at the front desk is the man not sure if we were going to spend the night in the city we walked in off the street  asked about available rooms after discussing prices  options matt took our number  called us when our room was ready which ended up being much nicer than i even expected 1bd suite absolutely amazing pushbutton curtains full kitchenlivingroom beverage stocked fridge washerdryer unlike others i love the minimalistic decor and found the staff gabriel doorbell  concierge ladies to be delightfully friendly accommodating  attentive i love the location 37th  5th garment dist same stores less crowded because its a nice retreat from hustle  bustle of times squaremidtown but still close to everything baffled at what others mean about the prices being higher dont think it even compares we will definitely be back soon glad we found this gem did i mention the bed was beyond expectation too like floating in a cloud even better than my marshmallow bed at home and windows that open in new york city refreshing and tilted so you can look straight down at the ground below
this is a place that cant decide whether it wants to be an apartment building or a hotel as some have commented the decor is decidedly along the lines of a corporate apartment the pricing is among the highest in the city i value serviceand the little touches that make a stay special and this place is not in the league of the ritz carlton central park the mandarin oriental the peninsula and others i stayed here over thanksgiving with my two daughters it was a lovely onebedroom apartment as opposed to hotel suite but there was no internet for half the stay half the time i called down to the front desk there was no answer the gym was lacking the staff was not up to a 5 star hotel we had thanksgiving dinner at the hotel and that was a very good experience even special but the rest of the stay mainly to do with the service was disappointing and thus i wouldnt pay the premium prices again the roomsapartments were first rate
i was here for five nights in august for a holiday the room was pleasant oversized and the bathroom was great every night i was presented with a complimentary evening snack id definitely recommend something that goes along the lines of lemon something something i was able to use the maserati four times during my stay id suggest to tip the bellman generously because it is the bellman who controls who uses the service i remember him declining the service to a couple when you could clearly see the car parked a block down although this wasnt in my package i was given complimentary breakfast vouchers and i made use of the shoe shine service which also was a nice amenity the personal assistant was also helpful all in all id definitely stay here again
this is my first stay in an andaz hotel i very much prefer it to w it is not as gimmicky my room was superb very tall ceiling and very large by any standard views of the library great amenities wonderful shower ipod docking station the work area is very useful the only quibb is the size of the open wardrobe i would have no hesitation at all to stay here again superb location in mid town on 5th ave
i thought the location of the hotel was excellent directly across from the library in the bryant park district the room was the very large modern clean sleek and one of the best bathrooms ever very unusual and unique for a boutique hotel i did not have a lot of interaction with the staff but everyone seemed pleasant and helpful i never got the feeling that the staff was trying to be anything other than service oriented i will say there wasnt anyone to help open the door but after walking from penn station with luggage i managed fine on my own if the location sounds appealing i would highly recommend the andaz
located about 2 blocks from 42nd street and 5th avenue which is the center of new york city the location could not be better you are walking distance from many great restaurants and attractions and a couple train stations including grand central so you can get nearly anywhere by subway or train plus there are buses and taxis if you can afford to burn money and get hostile service anyway back to the andaz 5th avenue everything was splendid from start to finish the checkin was not just smoothi was granted such a huge room upgrade that i was embarrassed while accompanying me upstairs to see if i would approve of the room i was basically drooling at the sheer enormity of the room two large bedrooms an ample livingdining area a generous balcony and the two baths were straight out of a palace i am very noise sensitive and this is always a worry when i am in a hotel and no matter how quiet it was in my room i never heard anything it helps to have had a large chunk of the building to myself the baths had exquisite amenities the most heavenly showers i have enjoyed the plushest towels i can recall and there were luxurious robes every where the bathrooms and the closets had several the high floor enabled me to leave the windows which are also the walls without the shades covering at night so i could take in the spectacular views ny public library empire state building etc every second i did not listen to the stereo nor watch tvdvds but the room was equipped to be entertained in style the minibarahhhh finally a minibar the way it would be if i chose what goes in it juices water delicious teas and nutritious snacks i think there may have been a beer or two but i did not notice on to a perfect nights sleep king orthopedic bed fine linens and not a sound plus the view of nyc from my bed breakfast yum as a diamond member i got a huge madetoorder breakfast that was about as good as i have ever had no charge oh and i called for breakfast before hours to have it delivered when breakfast began and there was a gentle knock on my door at the appointed time to the second i think the person bringing the food arrived a couple minutes early and waited for the precise second to knock and that is the kind of service the andaz 5th avenue gives i was sorry to have been solo as this was a room and experience to share checkout went without a hitch 4 pm as per diamond benefits and i was sure sorry to leave
situated directly across the street from the ny public library in a renovated retail building the location and service cant be beat its entrance on 41st is almost hidden the rooms are very modern and somewhat quirky  all electronic lightings and lots of glass and metal our room was very quiet with no view but we did not care since we were running around all over nyc on thanksgiving weekend very accommodating staff an excellent stay i highly recommend the andaz fifth ave
regular visitor of this hoteli believe is the best hotel in the best locationsimplecleannot crazy expensivenot noisy with great beds and near to all the attractions that i wanted to visitwe always take the 1 bedroom suitehas a living rooma small kitchinette and a large bedroomvery good value for money
we just returned from nyc after staying at the beacon this is our second stay we have stayed in both the regular rooms with kitchen and the suites suites are great with two separate rooms plenty of space great bed small kitchen and comfortable living room very well maintained and clean bathroom off the bedroom and well appointed staff is very attentive especially the ladies who clean the rooms leave a big tip very close to the 72nd street subway station and all the great attractions on the west side including central park natural history museum across the street is the fairway market a jewel itself to stock your kitchen at the hotel beacon liquors next store for that nice bottle of wineseems to have many international guestsyou can pay a lot more money in nyc but you wont do better
what an unexpected delight the hotel suite was two separate rooms and was decorated in a lovely way the kitchenette was nice with a full fridge only complaint is that there was no bottled water to buy or have as a guest amenity wonderful location near columbus circle
this was our second visit and we had two rooms  one for us and the other for our guests a family with two children the beacon is well located 2 blocks to subway an easy walk to central park and midtown rooms are large for nyc nicely appointed and clean very friendly and helpful staff excellent value
picked this hotel primarily for its location convenient to family here in houston as our weeklong stay progressed i realized that in every aspect of our stay this hotel exceeded our expectations room was clean and spacious staff was personable and professional and the location even better than i hoped all in all this turned out to be a great vacation thanks best western
im awarding this best western 5 stars as it met all my expectations in terms of price brand room etc it is not a 5 star luxe hotel but it is perfect if you are looking for a great place to stay at a decent price  extremely friendly hotel staff very welcoming and even printed off directions to attractions we were interested in  our family of 4 shared one room with 2 queen sized beds they immediately came to assemble the crib for my 1 year old daughter  daily foodcocktail hour from 57pm with delicious sandwiches and soft drinksbeers useful for hungry kids  big rooms very clean  free breakfast is a decent sized buffet  small pool jacuzzi and gym  free parking
ive stayed here twice the location is very convenient to downtown houston university of houston rice galleria etc the neighborhood looks a little rough but look a bit closer and youll see it is full of upscale townhomes and condos there are plenty of bars and restaurants within a mile and even more in downtown the rooms are spacious and comfortable the breakfast buffet is nothing special but is a nice touch
i must say i really enjoyed my stay here very close to downtown without the downtown prices the staff was great as well i enjoyed the free parking thank you to all of the staff for assuring my family and i had a great stay
the hilton americas houston is a very nice hotel and probably one of the nicest hilton hotels in the country all of the facilities are top notch including the lobby the executive lounge and the fitness center and spa which are located on the 23rd floor of the hotel the service is excellent the rooms are typical of recently renovated hilton hotels they have a pretty good breakfast menu and a breakfast buffet that is around 20 the hotel is connected by a bridge to the convention center and the hiltons conference rooms and spaces are all very nice and well appointed they have three floors of ballrooms and meeting spaces it is quite impressive things really are bigger in texas the location is right in the thick of everything downtown houston
this is a great businessconference hotel dont expect anything much in the surrounding area huge rooms and bathrooms executive lounge is a long way from some of the executive rooms hilton need to get with the times and stop charging for wifi access
we checked in early and they were able to find us a room we had trouble with the wifi and they were on that too we went out to eat and brought back leftovers and they provided us with a fridge and microwave when our cruise was delayed today and we requested late check out they have us until 3pm  the beds were comfy easy access to highways if there is a sporting event traffic can get a little rough but that isnt the hotels issue parking is 19 no free wifi  overall outstanding customer service
rooms were comfortable staff all friendly convenient to hobby airport the hallways are long here great shower attended a conference here and the food was served nicely and was good for conference food
after 4 months i returned to houston on another business trip and the hilton garden inn is just as good quick easy check in quicker checkout all staff were friendly and full of smiles hotel is clean room was clean breakfast is good with a good selection of items including cooked to order eggs many folks had heaped plates of food which is a good indicator this is a typical reliable garden inn the only item of note is that it is starting to show its age a bit and the hot water control was basically onoff
this hotel was clean modern friendly reception staff excellent and ticked most boxes room size average bathroom basic but had everything i needed although bath very slippy and a colleauge of mine who also stayed slipped and fell badly in the shower i felt that it was a bit too much self service during the day could not get anything to eat apart from the horrible microwave food available from the tiny shop there was a microwave in my room  weird no mini bar in my room so waking up thirsty with nothing to drink not nice too many margaritas meant early morning trip to the hotel shop in my jammies bar was also closed during the day so i could not purchase a bottle of wine to take when visiting friends pool area ok really just a sectioned off part of the car park so as long as your not shy in your bikini its fine   i was there on business and it was very handy for a lot of the large oil and gas companies i stayed in the omni on a previous visit and would stay there again over the hilton garden inn next time
i always stay at this hilton garden inn when i travel to houston due to close proximity to my company headquarter and still relatively easy to get to downtown houston and the galleria nothing fancy about the room but its functional and always as expected the bed is comfortable with adjustable dial to suit your preference they also have better than average breakfast menu but i believe without my company rate breakfast included the breakfast would be around 10 i consider it to be better than ihop or dennys  i do a lot of work on internet fast and free internet connection here for me is a big plus my last speedtest in july 2012 showed 940 mbps up and 646 mbps
i stayed here from june 2012 thru october 2012 for business i certainly had a great time id like to extend my thanks to mngr la tonya who made sure that everything was working in my room and int tiptop shape especially during renovation when all of the staff were too busy to fix my sink she tried to fix it herself and needless to say she made an attempt but it eventually was fixed the very next day a big thanks to sal and the entire front office yall are always attentive and friendly and thanks to the entire staff that made sure my room was definitely spotless weekly it certainly was a home away from home id like to extend whomever is looking for a great place with excellent service and with wonderful restaurants at walking distance come on down and see for yourselves this hidden gem of a place v s
im currently a guest resident at the extended stay america and i must say it as been a pleasure to be here latonya and her staff are very friendlyefficientattentive and very helpful and resource i would recommend this property for anyone coming for an extended stay or for a night or two
i guess this extended stay was recently upgraded to a deluxe but it is still just an extended stay property but with bagels and muffins rooms are nice and large with a kitchenette separate from the living area and the bed in its own area furniture in good condition except for the beds mattress its time to change out the bedding when there is a well worn dip in the middle while everything else was fine i do book hotel rooms to sleep in every room has a few flaws that can be overlooked this took it from very good to average i would have let them know if asked how my stay was but the young lady that checked me out did not seem that interested
manager latonya is wonderful she is very accommodating and friendly i have been here over a year and have never had a problem that wasn’t resolved in a very short period of time cleaning staff does amazing jobs in the rooms and the front desk staff know me by name and have always been a pleasure to talk too  if you need a place to stay in the northwest area of houston i highly recommend extended stay america on hollister a facility all the way
high level sophisticated place with an excellent restaurant and seamless service cant recommend this hotel enough it is in fact quite reasonably priced we stayed three nights using a hotel offer of a free third night if a free night at a four seasons hotel doesnt grab ya i dont know what willthen theres that super restaurant
i stayed two nights here first my room was not ready i know check in is at 3 and i arrived 10 minutes till 3 they made me wait un til after 3pm  i was running late to a meeting because of them next they finally put me in a room and it turned out to be a regular room when i had payed for a suite they sent the nice bellman back up and changed our room we dined at the restaurant in the hotel they messed up our order a couple of times the staff was okay some were friendlier than others not worth spending this amount of money for mediocre service
this hotel is considered a marriott property but is part of their autograph collection which is a group of independent hotels a former bank building this hotel did a great job with renovations the rooms are spacious and have lots of character the front desk staff is very friendly and the barrestaurant in the lobby has a great atmosphere and a pretty decent menu we enjoyed the buffet breakfast on sunday  1095 for a buffet that included your beverage not a bad deal the elevators are original to the building and are a bit on the small side but that is to be expected you do have to use your key to get to any of the guest room floors and this became a bit of an ordeal a couple of times my key wasnt working in the elevator and i ended up seeing five different floors before i could make it back down to the lobby to get a new room key a neat feature of this hotel is that it offers a free shuttle within a five mile radius we definitely got our use out of this however just beware that there is not much to dosee within a three mile radius in fact downtown houston seemed pretty desolate on the weekends across the street from the hotel is the preston station for the houston light rail metro at only 125 a fare its a good way to get to a few different parts of the city there are a handful of restaurants around the hotel one suggested to us by staff was macondo on congress  great diverse menu and an awesome place for breakfast if i would ever return to houston i would definitely stay here however i hope i never have to visit houston again but thats a different review
im a big fan of marriott gold member etc but this marriott property makes you want to go somewhere else my family had several rooms for a wedding weekend housekeeping was late and inconsistent  forgot to service the coffee pot on two days for example took 35 minutes to get ice delivered on checkout monday we had a 645 am cab to get to the airport hoping to take advantage of the breakfast buffet scheduled to open at 630 am we came down at 620 am but the buffet wasnt even opened until 640 so much for breakfast a nice physical redo of an old bank management seems to be challenged to have services which match
we booked a suite on the pent house floor on our wedding night although the room was clean and the view was nice overlooking the city this hotel left a lot to be desired apparently on the pent house floor there are also hospitality suites directly across the hall from the guest suites by design this is a very poor choice by the hotel as hospitality suites are typically for parties yes we were staying across the hall from a loud drunken open house party the music was loud the people were in and out of the suite causing a big disturbance in our suite a note was slipped under our door by the party hostess suggesting that she knew it was loud and that we should join them this is not at all what we had in mind for our wedding night at 1230am when we couldnt take anymore we checked out and found another hotel the attendant at the front desk was considerate and understanding as we conveyed the issues and didnt charge us for the room i can only think that the rental price for the hospitality suite was much more than our guest suite as no additional solutions to the problem were offered the whole experience was frustrating absent thatthe hotel appeared to be clean and nice
we stayed here after a christmas party and the room was very enjoyable and trendythis location was difficult to find and currently has construction next door during the daytime we slept in and woke up to the construction outside late in the morning not a big deal i suppose but some may not prefer that it does have a sweet spot next to a dinner movie theatre and shops alexs bistro inside the hotel was top notch and top price and everything was excellent except for the turtle soup which smelledtasted and looked unappetizing a live band played in the evening continental breakfast is catered from the la madeleine and excellent lots of fruit choices cereal and pastries are available they serve lattes and cappuccinos as well overall great stay
hotel sorella in a great location walking distance to terrific restaurantsbarsshops great staff there on a business conference and the catering was excellent and the conference staff very accommodating would recommend for event planners
wow what a surprise i was not expecting such a nice hotel on a university campus thanks to hhonors we were upgraded to a jr suite for a minimal fee which was very comfortable and spacious the bed was amazingly comfortable which is always a plus  the only complaints are that we requested breakfast by hanging the tag on the door and it was never retrieved and several of the staff speak very broken english and had a hard time understanding our requests  overall however very good hotel
i will admit that i stumbled upon this hotel and sure glad that i did hilton created a partnership with the college of hospitality at the university of houston and as a result the hotel is both a teaching ground as well as a platform of perfection the rooms are some of the best appointed that i have come in contact with the rooms are immaculate the staff is incredibly attentive and the area is wonderfully quiet located just a few exits from downtown the hotel is amazingly easy to access on and off hwy 45 there is not a question that i will be staying at this hotel every visit to houston i have
i stayed twice in this hotel while on a business trip in houston i wasnt expecting much from a university hotel and was worried about noise i was surprised located on the campus it is a very nice hotel with specious modern room and young friendly staff  room was very nice light with good bed and no noise internet worked flawless i ordered room service and really enjoyed it breakfast in the morning was promptly served and good  questions requests everything was answered and addressed right away i have yet another trip to hourston next month i know which hotel to book now
location genteel ambience comfort staffing of all services quality of dining room quality and cleanliness are exceptional have stayed four times and will always return cabs are hailed upon request and elevator operators add a sense of bygone times
location attention to detail size of room cleanliness staff professionalism harrys bar just excellent and will return
stayed there in may12 for 2 nights doing business in nyc the hotel is good centrally located well maintained and very clean bedrooms is classicly decorated with good bed well kept toilet there is free water and soda inside rooms the gym downstairs has good equipment but is a little claustrophobic had breakfast in the attached restaurant good service but expensive 20 dollars overall the hotel is very good but for 400500 dollars it is way too expensive even considering that its nyc
the sn is at the perfect location in the city everything is walkable or the subway is around the corner if you want to go that way this is a not a large corporately run property it is a relatively small building with the unit owners directing the hotel management company as such the staff is small and they know who you are they charge the usual nyc prices but watch for specials and you will do ok the accomodations are great  overall a most pleasant experience
my daughter grandson and i just spent a long weekend at the sch we had a suite that included two rooms two queen beds and a sofa sleeper and a kitchenette it was huge compared to other places ive stayed in nyc it was also clean the continental breakfast was perfect for us convenient with a nice selection of food items and drinks my only disappointment was that no welcome basket was waiting for my grandson i had written sch asking for help in pulling together a little gift to make my 6yearold grandsons first visit to nyc extra special i was told they would put together a complimentary one which would have been perfect unfortunately it didnt happen i just wish i would have known ahead of time so i could have done something on my own
my husband found this hotel on the internet and after reading the tripadvisor reviews we booked our stay for 3 nights in midtown nyc the hotel is central and in a calm street we arrived with a rental car at 8am and we were pleasantly surprised to find a parking right next door to the hotel  the person at the reception was very nice and even if we had booked the hotel the night to come she offered us to go and take the complementary breakfast in the lobby in the meantime i asked her to find the address of a pizzeria in brooklyn and she printed the pizzerias info and brought it to me the room was supposed to be ready at 3pm but as it was ready before we were able to go to our room at midday it was a one bedroom suite with 2 queen beds  1 sofa bed perfect for a family of 4 with 2 children who didnt want to sleep in the same bed we were told that there is no view as it is a small hotel 18 floors but it was a view for us see photo below  the hotel receives a lot of spanish speaking hosts and it is nice and cosy family hotel each and every of the employees we met during our stay were nice and helpful a man at the reception even did a magic trick to our son who laughed in delight complimentary umbrellas were offered to use when it started to rain which was much appreciated we found restaurants all around and the area is nice and relatively calm which was good as we were able to choose different food depending on our mood a hotel we will definitely go back to a very good place to sleep and spend calm and quality time to rest
i love to visit nyc and usually do so on girlfriend trips i have researched numerous hotels looking for those that have the ability to accommodate our needs san carlos is one of the very very few that offers two queen beds in a nice large room the san carlos is located across from the waldorf and is wonderfully situated for access to public transportation walking to your favorite big box stores restaurants etc etc the rooms are very clean the beds and bedding are very comfortable free wifi a desk mini fridge and bar and lounge chair the continental breakfast is convenient not a gourmet set up mind you but perfectly suitable for a quick bite to begin your day in the city ive stayed in rooms that face the back which has a view of the next building ive had lovely quiet stays both times im only there to sleep i actually get a kick out of watching the office building come to life from dark stillness to bright activity like a scene from a tv show the front desk is always the best part of my stay did you know there are two gentlemen there that have quite the set of pipes ask to find out who sings louie armstrongs its a wonderful world and who sounds like bing crosby
stayed in the hotel for a week room was very clean and comf with a little kitchen and fridge staff very helpful and friendly breakfest good but basic very convenient location will stay there again for sure
this is an excellent small hotel by new york standards in a quiet location of midtown within a few minutes walk of times square the theatre district bryant park and grand central the room we stayed in was quiet and comfortable and the staff were friendly and efficient there was always free coffee available in the lobby and the library had internet access and real time flight info i cant comment on the restaurant as we didnt eat in i would however recommend the red flame diner just along the street where you can eat breakfast with real new yorkers at a reasonable cost theres also gregorys coffee bar opposite the diner which serves an awesome carrot and raisin pound cake this was our first visit to new york and well definitely be back for more
i recently stayed in this hotel for three nights during a visit to ny what a gem of a place from the perfect location only minutes from time square st patricks cathedral 5th ave central park etc etc near subway stations so the entire island is within easy reach the staff were welcoming and accommodating my luggage did not arrive for 2 days so they did everything possible to help me out and contact the airlines on a regular basis the lobby is welcoming with coffeespiced cidar to enjoy  the room was quiet and perfect comfy bog bed with chocolates nightly and molton brown bits in the bathroom very useful when you had zero luggage lods of moveis to watch on your dvd player and a free newspaper every morning fantastic  i could not say enough good about this place will definitely be returning 
this unpretentious but comfortable good quality hotel is brilliantly located for manhattan visits the beds are comfortable  the rooms clean and bigger than some in nyc the staff are friendly and helpful especially the door staff we didnt eat there but the bars look great v busy
we recently stayed at the eventi new york and what an amazing time it made our vacation and we would definitely stay again and highly recommend this hotel this was an early birthday present for my 40th and i so want to return before arrival i had emailed through bookingcom that we were staying for a special occasion from the moment we walked through the door everything was 100 you are greeted by many smiley happy staff members we checked in to be told we had been upgraded to top floor amazing room we went up to our room on 23rd floor it was a corner room views of empire state building next to us and statue of liberty afar we wer thrilled that excited by the view we overlooked the bottle of champagne and cupcakes left for us with s note what a lovely surprise thank you patrick the bed was so comfortable the bathroom large and brilliant whole room was amazingly clean and comfortable was just like being at home maybe better the maid was very friendly  staff were always very friendly and helpful nothing too much trouble the free wine hour 56pm every day was excellent wine cheese  biscuits and a way of meeting other travellers which we did 10 min walk to times square 20 mins to central park t mins to subway we actually walked from staten island ferry point in battery park round wall street and 911 tribute site and then back to eventi was a great way to explore lower manhattan this hotel is in a prime location macys is also only 5 mins away walking subways are easy and so cheap so they should be used tom we actually used train and subway back to jfk airport so easy and so so unbelievable cheap all in all the eventi hotel made our holiday thank you would like to return terri halpenny
when flooding from hurricane sandy forced me to evacuate my lower manhattan apartment i had a latenight last minute search for a hotel in manhattan difficult that would also allow me to bring my two 60lb dogs virtually impossible and not spend 700 per night to do so after much searching with amex emergency services great job from them as well the eventi showed up as the only practical option i travel frequently and i often stay at kimpton properties because i like their unique designs i am lowmaintenance when im on the road and it is rare that the performance of the staff has any significant impact on my stay after a harrowing five days of urban camping in my powerless and waterless apartment the eventi staff took us all in like family and made the world seem safe and normal again patrick gabriella  and i wish i could remember everyones names but suffice it to say that the entire desk and valet staff were phenomenal robert the gm has pulled together a special group of people they greeted us warmly and played with our dogs the next morning staff that we hadnt even met knew the names of the animals and would greet them by name when i took them out for walks they offered treats they even remebered that one dog likes her head scratched and the other one likes his butt scratched they helped us with dry cleaning and laundry the housekeeping staff were excellent and had the room spotlessly clean every day  even the fur was gone when i had to bring a cat from my apartment because she was ill a filled litter pan and a small bag of cat food was waiting outside the room door when i returned i never even thought to ask for one our menagerie ended up staying for eight days until we confirmed that we would not be able to return to our apartment for several months and we relocated out of state to stay with family one night i was bringing back pizza to eat in the room from waldies  an excellent pie the doorman saw the box and said aha you discovered waldies their pizza is fantastic a few minutes later we were all sharing the pizza in the lobby and laughing and telling stories around the front desk like we had all been friends since college as for the room beautiful quite subdued by kimpton standards with lots of dark wood and chocolate tones very contemporary and elegant terrific bed sheets and pillows and the bathroom has a killer huge shower with multiple shower heads  of particular note to those who travel with their animals you know how most hotels have pet friendly rooms that the hundreds of pets have gotten waaaay too friendly with yeah that smell the room at the eventi showed absolutely no evidence of odor or dirt or scratches on the doors it was a perfectly beautiful room that became our home for a week obviously hurricane sandy will be an unforgettable event in my life however neither will the professionalism and true kindness shown by the eventi staff be forgotten we all thank you so much
just recently had a single night stay at the eventi the hotel and room were meticulously clean and well maintained which is always my first priority location is great close to subway stops and walking distance to penn station location is of course subjective in nyc depending on where you need to be we stayed in a cityview king on the 18th floor spectacular views our room faced east so we had an excellent view of the empire state building road noise was reasonable during the day and practically nonexistent at night with the blinds drawn hvac noise was of course present but within a reasonable level room was perfectly clean great condition and quite sizable by city standards bathroom was spacious modern and functional my only complaint with the entire property was with the bed i prefer a really firm mattress and this one was a bit soft for my liking actually seemed like the topper could use replacing that being said we slept fine pillows and linens were nice we ate breakfast and dinner in the restaurant and the food was very good culinary choices are plentiful in nyc but it’s nice to know that you can also get quality food without leaving the hotel there’s also a free wine hour in the late afternoon which my wife took advantage of she commented that it was a great opportunity to meet other travelers the staff were friendly and attentive we arrived at around 11am expecting to just drop off our luggage but they had a room available so we were able to check in immediately the day we checked out it was raining so i asked the staff were i could get an umbrella they said we could use the one from the room even though we were checking out and to just return it before we left the city these are just little things that make the stay more enjoyable great hotel great stay would highly recommend
stayed here for 6 nights the checkin staff and bellboys were fantastic especially catalina who arranged for an upgraded room after i enquired about the room size i did have to wait a while to check in due to the upgrade as the room wasnt ready but they gave me free cocktail vouchers and it was a nice experience itself to have a drink at the bar which eased the wait the room was beautifully decorated and very interesting  i wish i had a toilet like that in my home  but a few things didnt work and i cant help but think that having a lot of technology means more to maintain nothing was too problematic though i loved the magazines and books in the room the amenities case the nice big bathtub the soft gowns and the bathroom mirror tv breakfast is quite expensive so id recommend eating in the area or just grabbing a breakfast sandwich from pret this is definitely the type of hotel you stay in for pleasure it has no business centre for example so bear that in mind but i would definitely come back it was a great place to stay and very accommodating
this hotel was exactly what i wanted it to be for this particular trip  i wanted a romantic escape for just my wife and i while we attended the us open  the location is perfect and an easy walk to times square broadway and the subway a little bit longer walk for shoping short cab ride for quality shopping is best  the service front dest dorman butler and concierge were all top notch  i was worried that the art deco decor would seem cheesy and fake it is not it was sleek clean and calming the rooms are small but packed with style and technology the technology gets a bum wrap in some reviews but in truth it is easy fun to use and standard in many new high end hotels the bathroom is just coolhow often can you honestly say that  the hotel is very safe and secure the technology requires key card access to the elevators and the bell staff recognize guests  the spapoolfitness area is small but very nice it is a very peaceful place to relax after a busy day on your feet i would not stay here with young kids the rooms pool and common areas are small children may feel cooped up and be distruptive to the calm quiet and sophisticated vibe of this hotel
was supposed to be in town for a 3night stay that got extended due to hurricane sandy the staff is enthusiastic and not stuffy at all for a 5star hotel luckily i was able to keep the same room when i extended my staya woman was arguing with the front desk to get a room because her power had gone out due to sandy it wasnt a pretty scene in nyc at that time but that hotel experience made it so much better bathroom i stayed in a king regular room got upgraded because im a starwood member and had a shower no bathtub i was disappointed at first but it was made up for by the amazing shower there was a rain shower head and separate handheld showerhead the shower stall was so large it probably could have fit 3 adults comfortably it was such an indulgence to take a shower every day also the heated toilet seat was incredible with the bidet theres also a tv in the mirror boy do i miss that bathroom room the room is definitely dark but it was so comfortable i was okay with it it was larger than i thought it would be for nyc the tv is positioned well right in front of the bed i had a great nights sleep on that bed the minibar is located in the closet which has all these shelves with magazines books and even scented candles that you pay for location if you want to see shows its the best location also great for taking the subway
my husband and i just stayed at the setai fifth avenue when we checked in my husband was upset as there was no doorman on duty to assist with our luggage i went inside and asked the lady at reception to please get a doorman which she did we then were checked in and proceeded to our room upon arrival at the first room it was not the one that we had reserved almost 6months previously we were then taken to a second room which again was not the room we reserved my husband then left me with the luggage and he went downstairs to discuss this with them one of the front desk managers brian then assisted him and showed us to a room we had reserved which was one of the oneroom corner suites he said they would need to get it cleaned which would take about an hour and in the interim he escorted us downstairs for a meal in the restaurant at no cost to us brian then came in approximately one hour to escort us to our room the room was exactly what we had reserved and was a beautiful corner suite onebedroom this was the only snafu that we had upon checkin however brian corrected the problem for us and he was very courteous and helpful not only that night but the rest of our trip the rest of the staff were also very courteous and helpful and our fridge was restocked daily with the promised drinks etc we enjoyed our stay at the setai very much and highly recommend it
i had booked my stay at the setai as a 25th wedding anniversary50th birthday treat for my husband and myself setting this trip in context we are the parents of a profoundly learning disabled son and we had to negotiate and save our respite care for a year so that we could have our first holiday alone since our honeymoon this was to be the most luxuriousspoilt treat of our lifetime in april we booked the suite surrender package staying in an empire state suite the package at that time was similar to the one currently on offer which promised • the attention of a personal assistant a signature service provided by capella hotels and resorts • a couture kitchen filled with new york city’s finest flavors stocked once and entirely prior to your arrival • complimentary refreshment center  • a bottle of taittinger rosé champagne and fresh fruit upon arrival • a 100 auriga credit per night for treatments insuite or in the luxurious auriga spa  • complimentary pressing of up to 5 items and shoe shine on the date of your arrival unlike the current offer we were not promised the bergdorf goodman voucher but instead a luxury breakfast delivered daily to our suite  i specified that i wanted a room on as high a floor as possible and emphasised that this was a special occasion we were waiting for the call from our personal assistant prior to our arrival but the call didnt come on arrival at the hotel the door men did not open the door as we struggled through with our luggage and with only one member of staff on duty at reception joined the line to check in things started to look up when we were told we had been upgraded as this was a special occasion and we were allocated room 2702 bizarrelywe were walked to the elevator and whilst in the elevator the promise of pressed clothes was explained surely this should have been done at the reception desk  still we headed to our room excited about our upgrade this was an eagerly anticipated stay so i had devoured the website and all of the photos so when i entered the city one bedroom suite i was disappointed this was not and upgrade but a down grade although this suite was bigger in square footage it was a cheaper suite we looked for the bottle of champagne and fruit but there was none we looked in the fridge for the finest flavours of nyc and found 6 small bottles of soda a bottle of water and four milk creamers for coffee i was gutted i phoned down to reception but noone answered i phoned the personal assistant line only to told it was nothing to do with them and i needed to contact reception i explained i could not get through and asked if the city room was a lower grade room than an empire room i was told by the personal assistant that it was a downgrade and she put me on hold and eventually through to reception no apology was forthcoming for the poor service in fact i felt reprimanded for challenging the upgrade and was told that the suites had been renamed since i booked and that i indeed had an upgrade strange though that the same names are advertised currently on the website and that indeed the empire suite is about 300 a night more expensive that our city room the receptionist said she would send up the missing elements of our package when it was checked out we were by now exhausted having been travelling for over 21 hours we had just wanted to crack open the champagne drink to our anniversary and get some rest we waited over an hour for the delivery and then decided to get some sleep as the goods were clearly not coming half an hour into our sleep the door was persistently knocked my husband had to get up dress and answer the door to receive  the bottle of champagne  the fresh fruit  this was in fact a small plate of sliced fruit salad  a wine glass with more fresh fruit salad and plain yoghurt  a dish of nuts  three one oz pieces of cheese on a tray  a four pack of beer  a four pack of root beer sorry but do these latter 4 items classify as new yorks finest flavors in a five star hotel i was expecting a lot more and they did not stock the fridge they barely filled one shelf on rising on sunday 28th october we headed to ai fiori with our complimentary breakfast vouchers again we had been promised luxury breakfasts in our room instead we were given 6 continental breakfast vouchers for a muffin croissant and danish with orange juice and a coffeee hardly luxury even this was poorly served we submitted our vouchers and then were billed 60 we finished our coffees and had to ask for a refill my husband called over the waiter he went for the coffee pot then filled my husbands cup and walked away leaving my cup empty surely a michelin starred restaurant has heard of silver service we headed out into manhattan we would have loved at this point to have had our personal assistant organise a ride in the maserati as we were heading to tiffanys to get a ring to celebrate our occasion but as for the entire duration of our stay we were not allocated a personal assistant the signature service provided therefore we did not get that opportunity on no occasion did any member of staff apology for the lack of service or the failure to provide what was being paid for all of these issues are basic customer care issues a product was ordered and it was down to the staff of the setai to deliver but this was a total failure subsequent issues resulted from the skeleton staff in situ when we arrived back in the hotel after our few hours in manhattan we picked up the letter stating that due to the imminent arrival of hurricane sandy we would not have a housekeeping service so we did not have any of the snacks delivered each afternoon that previous guests have raved about we did not have any amenities replaced  ie soaps and when we ran out of nespresso capsules it took 3 requests and 9 hours before we had them delivered we appreciate that staff were under pressure by this time but we offered to collect the capsules from reception on two occasions and on each we were told they would be sent up to our room without any apology ironically they arrived 30 minutes before the power outage on monday we had no restaurant service and had to eat in the bar in the evening we were provided with a buffet dinner at a cost of 25 per person two choices of main course one potato one veg considering the conditions25 was taking advantage by monday night the power was out and so we were in darkness no elevators essential on the 27th floor no hot water in the morning and bread cheese and ham for breakfast  in summation during our luxury break we had  a downgraded room  one bedroom suite instead of empire state  which had been specifically requested  no personal assistant service  one turndown service  no daily clean of suite for entire stay  none of the promised surrender package until minimum arrived after complaint  no breakfast in suite  use of the nespresso machine for one out of three days due to lack of capsules  one breakfast in ai fiori  power and hot water for two out of three nights yet we were billed the full amount for our stay of over 3400 we did mention the lack of the suite surrender package specifically mentioning the lack of the spa vouchers and were cheekily told that we could have the vouchers what use would they have been with the spa closed and the power out we were offered a 50 reduction on the cost of our final night  the one with no power water or food which we did take but we were greatly under stress by this point we had just been told our flight was cancelled our son was due home with noone to care for him and we had to find a hotel in a city where 9000 flights had been cancelled stranding many others in a similar situation with hindsight we were sold short we should been paying the cost of a one bedroom suite without the package we should have had the 100 per night spa voucher returned along with 120 the apparent cost of the four breakfasts we did not get without basic housekeeping we should have received some compensation our lifetime holiday an opportunity we will never have again was in ruins not due to sandy but due to uncaring inhospitable staff  we are very understanding of the difficult situation that staff were put in when nyc went into close down but it needs to be stated that in our new hotel the westin grand central we were made to feel very welcome we were given free coffee when we arrived to check if they had room they gave us free wifi for our entire stay to allow us to get in contact with home to make arrangements for our son and they had such a friendly outlook that staff in the setai could learn from  this was sent to the setai management and a phonecall to discuss this has been promised but as yet has not happened it appears from subsequent reviews that our experience was not unique yet others seem to have a magical time customer service should be consistently of a high standard at any price
we just returned from a few nights at the setai we had a great time the staff was very helpful and made our stay wonderful we had a suite it was close to 1000 sq ft the suite was gigantic spacious well laid out and very clean nice turn down service with water and treats placed at the bedside the hotel bar had nice cocktails and good food bed was comfortable in room nespresso room was a nice touch the location is great  blocks from grand central so easy to get in and out
i booked a larger king and it was only slightly higher than regular rooms from marriott  but much much more comfortable and better in everyway bed was very comfortable crazy high ceilings and as i say the room was massive  one of the largest ive ever stayed at in manhattan and the staff as well as room service was terrific only criticism is i sent a few items to be printed out but they never made it and my laundry came back a day late
very modern hotel interior and very clean and comfortable with many wonderful ammenities the location is not great unless you like being close to the train station and library but it is so easy to get around new york city that this does not pose a problem i would stay there again
this hotel was a great location corner of 5th ave and 42nd stit was very modern but didnt seem slick in the service side of things the front office people werent as attentive or as friendly as what we expected the room we stayed in was okay although compared to the other hotel we stayed at in nyc lacked many extras the minibar was so basic it was almost a joke no water by the bed the bed wasnt that comfortablethe room just lacked detail  for what we paid it wasnt good value for money in our view not what would be expected of a hyatt hotel we would only stay here again if the room rate was a good deal as we paid similar rates at other hotels in nyc and received so much more i would recommend this hotel if you were wanting to be in the thick of the shopping frenzy then this would be a good choice
my partner and i went on holiday to nyc on 271012 the day before hurricane sandy and booked to stay at the hotel beacon after reading previous reviews on here it was recommended that we emailed in advance to request a high corner room away from the lifts i did choose to email in advance as i also wanted to inform the hotel that i was planning to propose to my girlfriend i received a swift response from the reservations department and they were very polite  upon arrival our room wasnt ready we were two hours early but the staff were very friendly and informative they recommend a few local shops and food places if we wanted to pass the time when we arrived back after just over an hour the room was ready and we were allocated a room on the 21st floor there is only 25 floors in the hotel i do not cope well with confined spaces etc but the speed of the lifts was excellent and i managed to survive the constant use  we arrived at our room and it appeared we had been given a larger room possibly because i emailed in advance and we also received a complimentary bottle of wine and box of chocolates which was a lovely touch the room was excellent large spacious very clean with more than enough storage the views from our huge window were fantastic the concierge were attentive and informative without being pushy this was my partners 6th time in nyc and they did not feel the need to tell her anything as she had good local knowledge  even though nyc pretty much shut down for a few days the housekeeping service was still available albeit on a reduced staff and they were very polite if you are there for a few nights we were for 5 i would recommend that on your first morning to leave a 10 dollar tip and a note to housekeeping then leave 23 for the duration of your stay and you will end up with plenty of extra toiletriestowelspillows etc or anything else you may need  the hotel staff kept all guests up to date with information regarding local facilities that were still available during the hurricane  we were both very impressed with hotel beacon and the staff and will certainly be planning on staying there again when we visit again next year it is extremely popular with a wide variety of ages and people visiting for various reasons i highly recommend the hotel beacon ps my partner agreed to marry me when i proposed i also received an email from the hotel to congratulate us
we needed a room at the last minute in manhattan and got a very good rate from the beacon we were treated with great sympathy by the friendly efficient reception staff and subsequently found that helpful attitude was typical of all the staff we encountered the room was spacious and clean and surprisingly very quiet  no sounds could be heard from neighbouring rooms or the floor above the hotel is in a very good location close to lincoln centre and central park a couple of blocks from the subway it seems to be a very busy family area and very safe lots of cafesand restaurants and a fabulous supermarket across the street we would certainly return
i have stayed at this hotel which is a residence hotel for over a dozen years what brings me back for so long is the fabulous service and value mary at the front desk has been there longer that i have been going there the entire staff is very attentive  when you stay here you are getting an apartment i have experienced both the studio and the one bedroom units all have been recently renovated basically we love this hotel and its location on the upper west side less that two blocks from the subway
we stayed here for three nights for our oldest daughters wedding at nearby holy rosary chruch the hotel is close to downtown but far enough away to avoid the traffic and noise they have free parking though paid parking is only 2 a day around the hotel a shuttle to downton during the week and free snacks wine and beer monday through thursday afternoons the place is super clean the staff helpful and the pool very nice the only thing we would like to see is the availability of at least a few larger rooms their largest room has only two queen beds and they have no roll aways so our family of six needed two rooms which gets expensive
this is a really nice hotel a bw plus so it is closer to a higher priced chain than the normal bw our room was large and very clean the bed was comfortable and of course it comes with the usual complimentary breakfast which was excellent and parking the location to downtown cannot be beat overall this was a great experience and i would stay here again in a heartbeat
a twonight stay here for work was a great experience the hotels location less than five minutes drive from downtown but at half the cost was great breakfast was decent the room was spacious and convenient  overall no complaints at all and id certainly stay here again on a future trip to houston
was in houston for work and stayed here this is truly one of the top hiltons i have ever stayed at the executive lounge is on the top floor of the hotel and overlooks the entire ciy they are very customer focused i highly recommend this hotel if you are in houston
it is so nice to come home for a long season of business travel but this hotel was like coming home the friendly staffclean rooms nice facilities great food were such a warm welcome i hope to go back for fun travel i look forward to the next stay and will recommend for any conferences
stayed 2 nights recently during a conference the hotel is a typical hilton  which is to say very nice the executive lounge has a decent selection of items during breakfast and cocktail hour the rooms are large with the usual hilton amenities there is no minifridge but you can request one when you check in  since the hotel is part of the convention center and across the street from the toyota center it is a great location if you are participating in something at one of those places otherwise this part of houston leaves alot to be desired room service was the one disappointment it was half cold and sub par i had breakfast in the hotel restaurant one morning it had the usual hilton buffet option which i always enjoy the buffet is a quality buffet with cook to order items and a selection of hot and cold items it is a bit pricey but worth it please note that the spencers steakhouse restaurant has closed it will be replaced by a mexican place of some sort although it didnt appear that would be the case anytime soon there is a ups store onsight or you can go across the street to the convention center and visit the fedex office there is some construction going on in this area of downtown so be aware that some sidewalks are blocked off  there is selfparking for 19 a day or valet for about twice that self park it is in a garage that is connected by a walkway  the hotel offers wifi for a fee one of the advantages of booking on the executive level is free internet my job requires it so between the free wifi and the snackscontinental breakfast in the el the slight increase in the room rate is worth it to me every single staff person i encountered was very friendly and helpful i always appreciate that i travel quite a bit and it is nice to stay somewhere that appreciates you as a customer and truly wants to meet any special requests you need
stayed here for a few nights last week it is much as before check in  good quick and friendly room  nice enough and clean enough bed very good as always toiletries again replaced haphazardly and noisy window ac wifi  worked much better on mid floor maybe improved overall breakfast  greasy cooked sausage and bacon had an omelette which was old and rubbery and some white bread toast which was dry missed the next couple of mornings even though free with my room rate as really didnt fancy it dinner  ate there one night as couldnt be bothered going elsewhere cobb salad was excellent burger was not very good probably a frozen one with plastic cheese  would eat a salad here again checkout  receptionist didnt make eye contact or acknowledge me so dropped the key and left even though she was just writing something again as i passed reception i sometimes felt like i was breaking into a conversation  this sort of behaviour needs work overall  i like this place and book it whenever i am in houston but its not as great as many seem to make out  book with caution understanding this is an ok hotel so just dont expect it to be amazing or you may be disappointed guess my rating is 35 but think it falls short of very good for reasons given management  please try to comment in plain and clear english i have read many of the responses and often have no idea what youre trying to say  still not sure if your last response to me was some kind of putdown or if you really intended doing something different based on my feedback thanks for a nice stay again this time rob
if youre on a longterm business trip in houston make sure youre at this hilton because theyll make sure that youre comfortable and well care for i was there for six weeks from midmarch through early may and the entire staff did their best to provide the comforts of home for me the general manager ken chef damon bartender jason the front desk guys and gals  all of them were great and went out of their way to make my stay as pleasant as possible i was most impressed the day that i had to go to the urgent care clinic left my phone there and a front desk gal hopped into the hilton van and retrieved it for me i was so grateful any time that there was an issue  and there are always minor issues at any hotel especially during a stay that lone  they fixed it pronto  and thats really what counts its not about perfection its about dedication and commitment to guest comfort and wellbeing and the hilton garden inn on katy freeway is the place to stay for that in houston
we had a night between flights and being hilton honors members decided to give this place a try the location is nothing special but the building is well maintained very quiet and the staff is friendly we especially appreciated a very good ac in our room fresh cookies a fridge and microwave in our room outdoor pool and a very clean room there are plenty of restaurants and stores in the area and the location is right off the i10 freeway would definitely stay here again
i travel alot with my job and vacationing with my wife on our harley davidson from the time i arrived in june 2012 to currently september 2012 the staff has been outstanding from the mgr latonya campbell front desk personal manuel meribel and sal who always has a smile housekeeping who works very hard to keep us all happy and to maintenance who keeps the hotel running smooth and looking good thank you for all that you do richard clark
it is my second time here and it has been a very gratefull experience to stay here quick friendly and helpfull service answer to all my questions with nice attitude nice rooms overall the kitchen i have never seen in my country a service like this is like be at home with all those things is very helpfull you can save money there you can cook watch tv swin in the pool wash yopur clothes do excersise have a light breakfast in the morning all this for the same price it really worth the value
i walked in and was greated with a smiling face even though the area was without power due to some severe weather they were kind enough to take all my information and put myself and my coworker in a room they just asked once power was on to come back so they could get a copy of our ids they were courtious enough to call a day ahead and make sure we had enough nights due to the nature of our travels the room was very tidy and clean the whole hotel was clean smelling and quiet even though this whole establishment was completely booked it was pleasant none the less to stay here i will be more than happy to stay here again
everything you want and expect in a firstclass hotel they want me to add more characters to my review but i really have nothing more to say if you can afford to stay in this lovely hotel you will not be disappointed is this 200 characters yet
this hotel continues to be one of our very favorites rooms are ultra clean the service is very very good  personable and the food  drink are excellent the workout facility is very nice  open 247 and the employees treat you like valued guests the best
ive been in houston quarterly for the past 14 years and the group im with has used several hotels over that period usually near iah as most of us travel in thus when our staff opted to go back downtown for meetings there was some angst it was misplaced the four seasons is one of the more comfortable places ive stayed in and especially well set up for our group pushing 90 people at each board meeting id be pressed to call houston a beautiful city with a charming ambiance nor is the hotel itself an interesting structure but the guest rooms are well decorated nicely sized and have excellent bedding especially in the case of the small suites to which im occasionally upgraded the meeting rooms are quite well designed and best of all everything works  including av and conference lines which in most places are disasters waiting to happen perhaps the nicest surprise is a small private dining room hidden behind the wine rack in the restaurant which can only be accessed by walking through the kitchen since the food and food service are both good it makes a quirkily cozy addition to a meal
looking to stay in houston texas if you are on business or pleasure or as in our case doing both the the four seasons in downtown houston is perfect we are here over thanks giving and it is quite a site to see the hotel gives great rates if you book in advance i got a two room suite for 187 dollars per night and is worth every penny a living room with large tv to watch 99 tv stations and lots of great movies whilst you get over your jet lag  the service in a 5 star hotel like the four seasons is just fantastic we have done the pool and got some rays eaten our way through steaks that i can only describe as massive and very tasty the staff cant do enough for you and this really is a nice touch that makes you feel special of course the english accent works to your advantage and people want to talk to you just to hear our accent the parade was yesterday for thanks giving today is black friday  the day to shop and find a bargin  if you need a great hotel in houston texas then this hotel should be on the list to check out mike and tona lord alderley edge cheshire uk
i would have given this hotel 3 stars or less if it hadnt been for the good customer service of the daytime hotel manager i stayed one night the room was clean and quite large with great amenities and style comfortable bed and very quiet staff were friendly and helpful  however at 4am i was awoken to the sound of running water in the bathroom this was very alarming i found water pouring in from a light socket above the toilet i called the front desk and they indicated the person above me had probably left the shower door open  causing the overflow of water i dont see how leaving the shower door open would have caused this  probably a tub or sink or worse  toilet overflowed this lasted about 5 min and then ended the front desk said the day manager would make things right in the morning luckily it was mostly dry by morning after calling the front desk the manager offered to reduce my bill by over 50 which i thought was a generous and acceptable remedy to the situation as a marriott rewards elite member i was given a free breakfast at the hotel restaurant because there is no executive lounge  which was very tasty valet parking is 28night only valet is available
erica was very hospitable and spoke to everyone entering the establishmentshe helped us with any question we had concerning everything from room service to attractions in the houston area service was great the room was clean and our stay was great
stayed here a week early november 2012 hotel entrance feels awkfard as its through a smallish side door with no guardvalet then through another door comes the hotel receptionloungebarrestaurant very nice modern hotel lobby dark wood seems to be a big theme in houston mostly friendly staff one guy when asked for recommendation couldnt seem to care less but everyone else we spoke to was nice i really like the deluxe room with kingsize bed and jacuzzi the room did feel like it hadnt been aired so would have loved to open the window but for security reasons that was not possible tried putting ac on high for a while to change the air but it didnt do much of a difference other than that small inconvenience bed clean very comfortable and couldnt ask for anything else would recommend
